{"chunk":{"0":"It is not always easy to distinguish clearly when one period ends and another begins. So, if we think of the history of modern India as beginning with the advent of the Europeans, we need to go back to what is generally considered the medieval period, i.e., the 15th century itself\u2014indeed to a time even before the Mughals came and established their empire. 21\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 22 A Brief History of Modern India The Portuguese in India The Quest for and Discovery of a Sea Route to India After the decline of the Roman Empire in the 7th century, the Arabs had established their domination in Egypt and Persia. Direct contact between the Europeans and India declined, and, with that, the easy accessibility to the Indian commodities like spices, calicoes, silk, and various precious stones that were greatly in demand was affected. In 1453, Constantinople fell to the Ottoman Turks, who were on the ascendant. ","1":"In 1453, Constantinople fell to the Ottoman Turks, who were on the ascendant. Merchandise from India went to the European markets through Arab Muslim intermediaries. The Red Sea trade route was a state monopoly from which Islamic rulers earned tremendous revenues. The land routes to India were also controlled by the Arabs. In the circumstances, the Europeans were keen to find a direct sea route to India. Fifteenth-century Europe was gripped by the spirit of the Renaissance with its call for exploration. At the same time, Europe made great advances in the art of ship-building and navigation. Hence, there was an eagerness all over Europe for adventurous sea voyages to reach the unknown corners of the East.The economic development of many regions of Europe was also progressing rapidly with expansion of land under cultivation, the introduction of an improved plough, scientific crop management such as crop rotation, and increased supply of meat (which called for spices for cooking as well as for preservation). Prosperity also grew, and with it the demand for oriental luxury goods also increased. ","2":"Prosperity also grew, and with it the demand for oriental luxury goods also increased. Venice and Genoa which had earlier prospered through trade in oriental goods were too small to take on the mighty Ottoman Turks or to take up major exploration on their own. The north Europeans were ready to aid Portugal and Spain with money and men, even as the Genoese were ready to provide ships and technical knowledge. It is also to be noted that Portugal had assumed the leadership in Christendom\u2019s\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b Advent of the Europeans in India 23 resistance to Islam even as it had taken on itself the spirit of exploration that had characterised the Genoese. Historians have observed that the idea of finding an ocean route to India had become an obsession for Prince Henry of Portugal, who was nicknamed the \u2018Navigator\u2019; also, he was keen to find a way to circumvent the Muslim domination of the eastern Mediterranean and all the routes that connected India to Europe. ","3":"Pope Nicholas V gave Prince Henry a bull in 1454, conferring on him the right to navigate the \u201csea to the distant shores of the Orient\u201d, more specifically \u201cas far as India\u201d in an attempt to fight Islamic influence and spread the Christian faith. However, Prince Henry died before his dream could become a reality. In 1497, under the Treaty of Tordesillas (1494), the rulers of Portugal and Spain divided the non-Christian world between them by an imaginary line in the Atlantic, some 1,300 miles west of the Cape Verde Islands. Under the treaty, Portugal could claim and occupy everything to the east of the line while Spain could claim everything to the west. The situation was thus prepared for the Portuguese incursions into the waters around India. It was in 1487 that the Portuguese navigator, Bartholomew Dias, rounded the Cape of Good Hope in Africa and sailed up the eastern coast; he was well convinced that the long-sought-after sea route to India had been found. But it was only ten years later that an expedition of Portuguese ships set out for India (in 1497) and arrived in India in slightly less than 11 months\u2019 time, in May 1498. ","4":"From Trading to Ruling Vasco Da Gama The arrival of three ships under Vasco Da Gama, led by a Gujarati pilot named Abdul Majid, at Calicut in May 1498 profoundly affected the course of Indian history. The Hindu ruler of Calicut, the Zamorin (Samuthiri), however, had no apprehensions as to the European\u2019s intentions. As the prosperity of his kingdom was due to Calicut\u2019s position as an entrepot,\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 24 A Brief History of Modern India he accorded a friendly reception to Vasco Da Gama. The Arab traders, who had a good business on the Malabar Coast were apprehensive and were not keen on the Portuguese getting a hold there. For centuries, the trading system in the Indian Ocean had had numerous participants\u2014Indians, Arabs, Africans from the east coast, Chinese, Javanese, among others\u2014but these participants had acted according to some tacit rules of conduct and none had sought overwhelming dominance though all were in it for profit. ","5":"The Portuguese changed that: they wanted to monopolise the hugely profitable eastern trade by excluding competitors, especially the Arabs. Vasco da Gama stayed in India for three months. When he returned to Portugal, he carried back with him a rich cargo and sold the merchandise in the European market at a huge profit. The importance of direct access to the pepper trade was made clear by the fact that elsewhere the Europeans, who had to buy through Muslim middlemen, would have had to spend ten times as much for the same amount of pepper. Not surprisingly, other profit-seeking merchants of European nations were tempted to come to India and trade directly. A voyage was undertaken by Pedro Alvarez Cabral to trade for spices; he negotiated and established a factory at Calicut, where he arrived in September 1500. There was an incident of conflict when the Portuguese factory at Calicut was attacked by the locals, resulting in the death of several Portuguese. ","6":"In retaliation, Cabral seized a number of Arab merchant ships anchored in the harbour, and killed hundreds of their crew besides confiscating their cargo and burning the ships. Calicut was bombarded by Cabral. Later, Cabral succeeded in making advantageous treaties with the local rulers of Cochin and Cannanore. Vasco da Gama once again came to India in 1501. The Zamorin declined to exclude the Arab merchants in favour of the Portuguese when Vasco Da Gama combined commercial greed with ferocious hostility and wreaked vengeance on Arab shipping wherever he could. His rupture with the Zamorin\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b Advent of the Europeans in India 25 View The landing of Vasco da Gama at Calicut in 1498 ... is generally regarded as the beginning of a new era in world history, especially in the relationship between Asia and Europe. ","7":"This, however, was only one of the objectives of the Portuguese. For the Portuguese, the opening of a new sea-route to India would give a big blow to the Muslims, the Arabs, and the Turks, who were the traditional enemies of Christianity, and were posing a new threat to Europe by virtue of the growing military and naval power of the Turks. A direct sea-link with India would displace the virtual monopoly of the Arabs and Turks over the trade in eastern goods, especially spices. They also vaguely hoped by their exploration of Africa they would be able to link up with the kingdom of the legendary Prester John, (also called Presbyter John or John the Elder, believed to have been a Christian ruler of the East and popularised as such in medieval chronicales of the West) and be in a position to attack the Muslims from two sides. ","8":"Thus, the commercial and religious objectives supported and justified each other.\u2014Satish Chandra thus became total and complete. Vasco da Gama set up a trading factory at Cannanore. Gradually, Calicut, Cannanore, and Cochin became the important trade centres of the Portuguese.Gradually, under the pretext of protecting the factories and their trading activities, the Portuguese got permission to fortify these centres. Francisco De Almeida In 1505, the King of Portugal appointed a governor in India for a three-year term and equipped the incumbent with sufficient force to protect the Portuguese interests. Francisco De Almeida, the newly appointed governor, was asked to consolidate the position of the Portuguese in India and to destroy Muslim trade by seizing Aden, Ormuz, and Malacca. He was also advised to build fortresses at Anjadiva, Cochin,\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 26 A Brief History of Modern India View As long as you may be powerful at sea you will hold India as yours; and if you do not possess this power, little will avail you a fortress on shore. \u2014Francisco De Almeida Cannanore, and Kilwa. ","9":"\u2014Francisco De Almeida Cannanore, and Kilwa. What Almeida, however, encountered along with the opposition of the Zamorin, was a threat from the Mameluke Sultan of Egypt. Encouraged by the merchants of Venice, whose lucrative commerce was now at risk due to the Portuguese interference, the Egyptians raised a fleet in the Red Sea to stop the advance of the Portuguese. In 1507, the Portuguese squadron was defeated in a naval battle off Diu by the combined Egyptian and Gujarat navies, and Almeida\u2019s son was killed. Next year, Almeida avenged his defeat by totally crushing the two navies. Almeida\u2019s vision was to make the Portuguese the master of the Indian Ocean. His policy was known as the Blue Water Policy (cartaze system). Alfonso de Albuquerque Albuquerque, who succeeded Almeida as the Portuguese governor in India, was the real founder of the Portuguese power in the East, a task he completed before his death. He secured for Portugal the strategic control of the Indian Ocean by establishing bases overlooking all the entrances to the sea. ","10":"He secured for Portugal the strategic control of the Indian Ocean by establishing bases overlooking all the entrances to the sea. There were Portuguese strongholds in East Africa, off the Red Sea, at Ormuz; in Malabar; and at Malacca. The Portuguese, under Albuquerque bolstered their stranglehold by introducing a permit system for other ships and exercising control over the major ship-building centres in the region. The non- availability of timber in the Gulf and Red Sea regions for ship-building also helped the Portuguese in their objectives. Albuquerque acquired Goa from the Sultan of Bijapur in 1510 with ease; the principal port of the Sultan of Bijapur became \u201cthe first bit of Indian territory to be under the Europeans since the time of Alexander the Great\u201d. An interesting feature of his rule was the abolition of sati.\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b Advent of the Europeans in India 27 View Bitter persecution of Muslims was one serious drawback of Albuquerque\u2019s policy. This could have been due to his resolve to further the interests of his countrymen by complete extinction of Muslim commercial interests in the East. ","11":"This could have been due to his resolve to further the interests of his countrymen by complete extinction of Muslim commercial interests in the East. During his rule, Albuquerque did his best to strengthen the fortifications of Goa and enhance its commercial importance. In order to secure a permanent Portuguese population in India he encouraged his men to take Indian wives. The Gazetteer of India, Vol. II The Portuguese men who had come on the voyages and stayed back in India were, from Albuquerque\u2019s day, encouraged to take local wives. In Goa and the Province of the North, they established themselves as village landlords, often building new roads and irrigation works, introducing new crops like tobacco and cashew nut, or better plantation varieties of coconut besides planting large groves of coconut to meet the need for coir rigging and cordage. In the cities, they settled as artisans and master-craftsmen, besides being traders. Most of such Portuguese came to look upon their new settlements, rather than Portugal, as home. ","12":"Nino da Cunha Nino da Cunha assumed office of the governor of Portuguese interests in India in November 1529 and almost one year later shifted the headquarters of the Portuguese government in India from Cochin to Goa. Bahadur Shah of Gujarat, during his conflict with the Mughal emperor Humayun, secured help from the Portuguese by ceding to them in 1534 the island of Bassein with its dependencies and revenues. He also promised them a base in Diu. However, Bahadur Shah\u2019s relations with the Portuguese became sour when Humayun withdrew from Gujarat in 1536. Since the inhabitants of the town started fighting with the Portuguese, Bahadur Shah wanted to raise a wall of partition. Opposing this, the Portuguese started negotiations, in the course of which the ruler of Gujarat was invited to a Portuguese ship and killed in 1537. ","13":"In the Deccan, the Bahmani Kingdom was breaking up into smaller kingdoms. None of the powers had a navy worth its name, nor did they think of developing their naval strength. In the Far East, the imperial decree of the Chinese emperor limited the navigational reach of the Chinese ships. As regards the Arab merchants and ship-owners who until then dominated the Indian Ocean trade, they had nothing to match the organisation and unity of the Portuguese. Moreover, the Portuguese had cannons placed on their ships. Portuguese State The general tendency is to underestimate the Portuguese hold in India. However, the Estado Portugu\u00eas da India (State of the Portuguese India) was in fact a larger element in Indian history than it is given credit for. Many of the coastal parts of India had come under Portuguese power within fifty years of Vasco da Gama\u2019s arrival. The Portuguese had occupied some sixty miles of coast around Goa. ","14":"Many of the coastal parts of India had come under Portuguese power within fifty years of Vasco da Gama\u2019s arrival. The Portuguese had occupied some sixty miles of coast around Goa. On the west coast from Mumbai to Daman and Diu to the approaches to Gujarat, they controlled a narrow tract with four important ports and hundreds of towns and villages. In the south, they had under them a chain of seaport fortresses and trading-posts like Mangalore, Cannanore, Cochin, and Calicut. And though their power in Malabar was not consolidated, it was enough to ensure influence or control over the local rulers who held the spice-growing land. The Portuguese established further military posts and settlements on the east coast at San Thome (in Chennai) and Nagapattinam (in Tamil Nadu). Towards the end of the 16th century, a wealthy settlement had grown at Hooghly in West Bengal. Envoys and ambassadors were exchanged between Goa and many of the major kingdoms in India of the time. Treaties were signed between Goa and the Deccan sultans in 1570, which were regularly renewed as long as their kingdoms\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b Advent of the Europeans in India 29 lasted. ","15":"The Portuguese always had a role to play in the successive battles for the balance of power between Vijayanagara and the Deccan sultans, between the Deccanis and the Mughals, and between the Mughals and the Marathas. Interestingly, the Portuguese, the first Europeans to come to India, were also the last to leave this land. It was 1961 before the Government of India recaptured Goa, Daman and Diu from them. Portuguese Administration in India The head of the administration was the viceroy who served for three years, with his secretary and, in later years, a council. Next in importance came the Vedor da Fazenda, responsible for revenues and the cargoes and dispatch of fleets. The fortresses, from Africa to China, were under captains, assisted by \u2018factors\u2019, whose power was increased by the difficulties of communication and was too often used for personal ends. Religious Policy of the Portuguese The Moors were the bitter enemies of the Portuguese in North Africa. So were the Arabs. ","16":"Religious Policy of the Portuguese The Moors were the bitter enemies of the Portuguese in North Africa. So were the Arabs. Arriving in the East, the Portuguese brought with them the same zeal to promote Christianity and the wish to persecute all Muslims. Intolerant towards the Muslims, the Portuguese were initially quite tolerant towards the Hindus. However, over time, after the introduction of the Inquisition in Goa, there was a change and Hindus were also persecuted. But, in spite of this intolerant behaviour, the Jesuits made a good impression at the court of Akbar, mainly due to the Mughal emperor\u2019s interest in questions of theology. In September 1579, Akbar forwarded a letter to the authorities at Goa, requesting them to send two learned priests. The Church authorities in Goa eagerly accepted the invitation, seeing in it a chance to convert the emperor to Christianity, and with him his court and the people. Jesuit fathers, Rodolfo Aquaviva and Antonio Monserrate, were selected for the purpose.

The second mission called by Akbar in 1590 also ended on a similar note in 1592. The third mission, again invited by Akbar, arrived in 1595 at Lahore (where the court was then residing) and continued as a sort of permanent institution, thereby extending its influence on secular politics. Fathers Jerome Xavier and Emanuel Pinheiro were the leaders of the mission, and their letters from the court became very widely known for the information they provided on the later part of Akbar\u2019s reign. Prince Salim, on ascending the throne as Jahangir, assuaged the Muslims by neglecting the Jesuit fathers. Gradually, however, his temporary estrangement from the Jesuits ended, and in 1606, he renewed his favours to them. The elegant and spacious church at Lahore was allowed to be retained by them along with the collegium or the priests\u2019 residence. ","18":"The elegant and spacious church at Lahore was allowed to be retained by them along with the collegium or the priests\u2019 residence.

Jahangir\u2019s conduct was such that the Jesuit priests became hopeful of bringing him within the Christian fold. However, these hopes were belied. Moreover, arrogant actions on the part of the Portuguese viceroys created a rift with the Mughal emperor. Portuguese Lose Favour with the Mughals In 1608, Captain William Hawkins with his ship Hector reached Surat. He brought with him a letter from James I, King of England, to the Mughal court of Jahangir, requesting permission to do business in India. Father Pinheiro and the Portuguese authorities did their best to prevent Hawkins from reaching the Mughal court, but they did not succeed. Jahangir accepted the gifts Hawkins brought for him and gave Hawkins a very favourable reception in 1609.

Hawkins was also married to the daughter of an Armenian Christian named Mubarak Shah (Mubarikesha). The grant of trading facilities to the English offended the Portuguese. However, after negotiations, a truce was established between the Portuguese and the Mughal emperor. The Portuguese stopped the English ships from entering the port of Surat. A baffled Hawkins left the Mughal court in 1611, unable to counter the Portuguese intrigues or check the vacillating Mughal policies. However, in November 1612, the English ship Dragon under Captain Best along with a little ship, the Osiander, successfully fought a Portuguese fleet. Jahangir, who had no navy worth its name, learnt of the English success and was greatly impressed. The Portuguese acts of piracy also resulted in conflict with the imperial Mughal government.

In 1613, the Portuguese offended Jahangir by capturing Mughal ships, imprisoning many Muslims, and plundering the cargoes. An enraged Jahangir ordered Muqarrab Khan, who was then in charge of Surat, to obtain compensation. However, it was during the reign of Shah Jahan, that the advantages which the Portuguese enjoyed in the Mughal court were lost forever. Also lost were the hopes of converting the royal family and Mughal India to Christianity, a hope that the Portuguese held because of the welcome accorded to them and their religion by Akbar and Jahangir. Capture of Hooghly On the basis of an imperial farman circa 1579, the Portuguese had settled down on a river bank which was a short distance from Satgaon in Bengal to carry on their trading activities. Over the years, they strengthened their position by constructing big buildings which led to the migration of the trade from Satgaon to the new port known as Hooghly. ","21":"They monopolised the manufacture of salt, built a custom house of their own, and started enforcing strictly the levy of duty on tobacco, which had become an important article of trade since its introduction at the beginning of the 17th century.\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 32 A Brief History of Modern India The Portuguese not only made money as traders but also started a cruel slave trade by purchasing or seizing Hindu and Muslim children, whom they brought up as Christians. In the course of their nefarious activities, they seized two slave girls of Mumtaz Mahal. On June 24, 1632, the Mughal siege of Hooghly began, ending in its capture three months later. Shah Jahan ordered the Bengal governor Qasim Khan to take action against the Portuguese. The siege of Hooghly finally led to the Portuguese fleeing. The Mughals suffered a loss of 1,000 men, but also took 400 prisoners to Agra. The prisoners were offered the option to convert to Islam or become slaves. The persecution of Christians continued for some time after which it died down gradually. ","22":"Decline of the Portuguese By the 18th century, the Portuguese in India lost their commercial influence, though some of them still carried on trade in their individual capacity and many took to piracy and robbery. In fact, Hooghly was used by some Portuguese as a base for piracy in the Bay of Bengal. The decline of the Portuguese was brought about by several factors. The local advantages gained by the Portuguese in India were reduced with the emergence of powerful dynasties in Egypt, Persia, and North India and the rise of the turbulent Marathas as their immediate neighbours. (The Marathas captured Salsette and Bassein in 1739 from the Portuguese.) The religious policies of the Portuguese, such as the activities of the Jesuits, gave rise to political fears. Their antagonism for the Muslims apart, the Portuguese policy of conversion to Christianity made Hindus also resentful. Their dishonest trade practices also evoked a strong reaction. The Portuguese earned notoriety as sea pirates. ","23":"The Portuguese earned notoriety as sea pirates.

The earlier monopoly of knowledge of the sea route to India held by the Portuguese could not remain a secret forever; soon enough the Dutch and the English, who were learning the skills of ocean navigation, also learnt of it. ","24":"As new trading communities from Europe arrived in India, there began a fierce rivalry among them. In this struggle, the Portuguese had to give way to the more powerful and enterprising competitors. The Dutch and the English had greater resources and more compulsions to expand overseas, and they overcame the Portuguese resistance. ","25":"Goa which remained with the Portuguese had lost its importance as a port after the fall of the Vijayanagara empire and soon it did not matter in whose possession it was. The spice trade came under the control of the Dutch, and Goa was superseded by Brazil as the economic centre of the overseas empire of Portugal. In 1683, after two naval assaults, the Marathas invaded Goa. Significance of the Portuguese Most historians have observed that the coming of the Portuguese not only initiated what might be called the European era, it marked the emergence of naval power. The Cholas, among others, had been a naval power, but it was now for the first time a foreign power had come to India by way of the sea. The Portuguese ships carried cannon, and this was the first step in gaining monopoly over trade\u2014with the threat or actual use of force. ","26":"The Portuguese ships carried cannon, and this was the first step in gaining monopoly over trade\u2014with the threat or actual use of force. The Portuguese declared their intention to abide by no rules except their own, and they were intent on getting a decisive advantage over the Indians and over the Indian Ocean trading system. In the Malabar of the 16th century, the Portuguese showed military innovation in their use of body armour, matchlock men, and guns landed from the ships. The Portuguese may have contributed by example to the Mughal use of field guns, and the \u2018artillery of the stirrup\u2019. However, an important military contribution made by the Portuguese onshore was the system of drilling groups of infantry, on the Spanish model, introduced in the 1630s as a counter to Dutch pressure. The practice was adopted first by the French and English, and later taken up by the Marathas and Sikhs, and such armies of sepoys became new tools of empire in India. The Portuguese were masters of improved techniques at sea. ","27":"Their multi-decked ships were heavily constructed, designed as they were to ride out Atlantic gales rather than run before the regular monsoons; this permitted them to carry a heavier armament. Their use of castled prow and stern was a noteworthy method by which to repel or launch boarding\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b Advent of the Europeans in India 35 parties. Indian builders adapted both to their own use. However, the Portuguese skill at organisation\u2014as in the creation of royal arsenals and dockyards and the maintenance of a regular system of pilots and mapping and pitting state forces against private merchant shipping\u2014was even more noteworthy. The Mughals and Marathas may certainly have learnt from the Portuguese, but the more certain heirs of this knowledge were other Europeans, especially the Dutch and English, in Asia. In India, the memory of religious persecution and cruelty detracts from the other contributions made by the Portuguese in the cultural field. However, it cannot be forgotten that the missionaries and the Church were also teachers and patrons in India of the arts of the painter, carver, and sculptor.

However, though the interior of churches built under the Portuguese have plenty of woodwork and sculpture and sometimes painted ceilings, they are generally simple in their architectural plan. The Dutch Commercial enterprise led the Dutch to undertake voyages to the East. Cornelis de Houtman was the first Dutchman to reach Sumatra and Bantam in 1596. In 1602, the States- General of the Netherlands amalgamated many trading companies into the East India Company of the Netherlands. This company was also empowered to carry on war, to conclude treaties, to take possession of territory, and to erect fortresses.

They carried indigo manufactured in the Yamuna valley and Central India, textiles and silk from Bengal, Gujarat and the Coromandel, saltpetre from Bihar, and opium and rice from the Ganga valley. ","30":"Anglo-Dutch Rivalry The English were also at this time rising to prominence in the Eastern trade, and this posed a serious challenge to the commercial interests of the Dutch. Commercial rivalry soon turned into bloody warfare. The climax of the enmity between the Dutch and the English in the East was reached at Amboyna (a place in present-day Indonesia, which the Dutch had captured from the Portuguese in 1605) where they massacred ten Englishmen and nine Japanese in 1623. This incident further intensified the rivalry between the two European companies. After prolonged warfare, both the parties came to a compromise in 1667 by which the British agreed to withdraw all their claims on Indonesia, and the Dutch retired from India to concentrate on their more profitable trade in Indonesia. They monopolised the trade in black pepper and spices. The most important Indian commodities the Dutch traded in were silk, cotton, indigo, rice, and opium.

The Dutch were not much interested in empire building in India; their concerns were trade. In any case, their main commercial interest lay in the Spice Islands of Indonesia from where they earned a huge profit through business. The English Charter of Queen Elizabeth I Francis Drake\u2019s voyage around the world in 1580 and the English victory over the Spanish Armada in 1588 generated a new sense of enterprise in the British, encouraging sailors to venture out to the East. As the knowledge grew of the high profits earned by the Portuguese in Eastern trade, English traders too wanted a share. So, in 1599, a group of English merchants calling themselves the \u2018Merchant Adventurers\u2019 formed a company. On December 31, 1600, Queen Elizabeth I issued a charter with rights of exclusive trading to the company named the \u2018Governor and Company of Merchants of London trading into the East Indies\u2019.

In 1611, the English had started trading at Masulipatnam on the south-eastern coast of India and later established a factory there in 1616. It was in 1612 that Captain Thomas Best defeated the Portuguese in the sea off Surat; an impressed Jahangir granted permission to the English in early 1613 to establish a factory at Surat under Thomas Aldworth. ","34":"In 1615, Sir Thomas Roe came as an accredited ambassador of James I to the court of Jahangir, staying on there till February 1619. Though he was unsuccessful in concluding a commercial treaty with the Mughal emperor, he was able to secure a number of privileges, including permission to set up factories at Agra, Ahmedabad, and Broach. The English company did not have a smooth progress. It had to contend with the Portuguese and the Dutch in the beginning. But the changing situation helped them and turned things in their favour. Bombay had been gifted to King Charles II by the King of Portugal as dowry when Charles married the Portuguese princess Catherine in 1662. Bombay was given over to the East India Company on an annual payment of 10 pounds only in 1668. Later, Bombay was made the headquarters by shifting the seat of the Western Presidency from Surat to Bombay in 1687. So, there was tacit peace between the English and the Portuguese now. ","35":"There was also an Anglo-Dutch compromise as mentioned earlier by which the Dutch agreed not to interfere with the English company\u2019s trade in India. Thus, the English were rid of two arch-rivals in India.\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b Advent of the Europeans in India 39 The English company\u2019s position was improved by the \u2018Golden Farman\u2019 issued to them by the Sultan of Golconda in 1632. On a payment of 500 pagodas a year, they earned the privilege of trading freely in the ports of Golconda. A member of the Masulipatnam council, the British merchant Francis Day in 1639 received from the ruler of Chandragiri permission to build a fortified factory at Madras which later became the Fort St. George and replaced Masulipatnam as the headquarters of the English settlements in south India. Thereafter, the English extended their trading activities to the east and started factories at Hariharpur in the Mahanadi delta and at Balasore (in Odisha) in 1633. Foothold in Bengal Bengal was then a large and rich province in India, advanced in trade and commerce. ","36":"Commercial and political control over Bengal naturally appeared an attractive proposition to the profit-seeking English merchants. Bengal was also an important province of the Mughal empire. Shah Shuja, the subahdar (or governor) of Bengal in 1651, allowed the English to trade in Bengal in return for an annual payment of Rs 3,000, in lieu of all duties. Factories in Bengal were started at Hooghly (1651) and other places like Kasimbazar, Patna, and Rajmahal. Nevertheless, despite the privileges of the farmans, the Company\u2019s business was now and then obstructed by customs officers in the local checkposts who asked for payment of tolls. In pursuance of its changed policy, the Company wanted to have a fortified settlement at Hooghly so that force could be used if necessary. William Hedges, the first agent and governor of the Company in Bengal, appealed to Shaista Khan, the Mughal governor of Bengal in August 1682, for redressal of the grievance. As nothing came out of the appeal, hostilities broke out between the English and the Mughals. ","37":"As nothing came out of the appeal, hostilities broke out between the English and the Mughals. Four years later, Hooghly was sacked by the imperial Mughals in October 1686. The English retaliated by capturing the imperial forts at Thana (modern Garden Reach), raiding Hijli in east Midnapur and storming the Mughal fortifications at\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 40 A Brief History of Modern India Balasore. However, the English were forced to leave Hooghly and were sent to an unhealthy location at the mouth of River Ganga.After the Mughal raid on Hooghly, Job Charnock, a company agent, started negotiations with the Mughals so as to return to a place called Sutanuti. Charnock signed a treaty with the Mughals in February 1690, and returned to Sutanuti in August 1690. Thus, an English factory was established on February 10, 1691, the day an imperial farman was issued, permitting the English to \u201ccontinue contentedly their trade in Bengal\u201d on payment of Rs 3,000 a year in lieu of all dues.

The fortified settlement was named Fort William in the year 1700 when it also became the seat of the eastern presidency (Calcutta) with Sir Charles Eyre as its first president. Farrukhsiyar\u2019s Farmans In 1715, an English mission led by John Surman to the court of the Mughal emperor Farrukhsiyar secured three famous farmans, giving the Company many valuable privileges in Bengal, Gujarat and Hyderabad. The farmans thus obtained were regarded the Magna Carta of the Company. Their important terms were: \u25cf In Bengal, the Company\u2019s imports and exports were exempted from additional customs duties excepting the annual payment of 3,000 rupees as settled earlier. \u25cf The Company was permitted to issue dastaks (passes) for the transportation of such goods. \u25cf The Company was permitted to rent more lands around Calcutta.

Merging of Two English Companies After the English revolution of 1688, the Whigs, with their enhanced influence, opposed the monopoly of the East India Company. Thus, a rival company was formed which deputed Sir William Norris as its ambassador to the court of Aurangzeb (January 1701\u2013April 1702) to gain trading privileges for itself. The new company, however, proved a failure. Under pressure from the Crown and the Parliament, the two companies were amalgamated in 1708 under the title of \u2018United Company of Merchants of England Trading to the East Indies\u2019. This was the East India Company\u2014from 1708 to 1873\u2014which was to establish British political power in India. ","42":"The French Foundation of French Centres in India Although the French harboured a wish to engage in the commerce of the East since the opening years of the 16th century, their appearance on the Indian coasts was late. Indeed, the French were the last Europeans to come to India with the purpose of trade. During the reign of Louis XIV, the king\u2019s famous minister Colbert laid the foundation of the Compagnie des Indes Orientales (French East India Company) in 1664, in which the king also took a deep interest. The Compagnie des Indes Orientales was granted a 50-year monopoly on French trade in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. The French king also granted the company a concession in perpetuity for the island of Madagascar, as well as any other territories it could conquer. The Company spent a lot of its money and resources in trying to revive the colonies of Madagascar but without any success. Then, in 1667, Francois Caron headed an expedition to India, setting up a factory in Surat. Mercara, a Persian who accompanied Caron, founded another French factory in Masulipatnam in 1669 after obtaining a patent from the Sultan of Golconda.

Pondicherry was founded in 1674. In the same year, Francois Martin replaced Caron as the French governor. The French company established its factories in other parts of India also, particularly in the coastal regions. Mahe, Karaikal, Balasore, and Qasim Bazar were a few important trading centres of the French East India Company. After taking charge of Pondicherry in 1674, Francois Martin developed it as a place of importance. It was, indeed, the stronghold of the French in India. ","44":"It was, indeed, the stronghold of the French in India. Early Setbacks to the French East India Company The French position in India was badly affected with the outbreak of war between the Dutch and the French. Bolstered by their alliance with the English since the Revolution of 1688, the Dutch captured Pondicherry in 1693. Although the Treaty of Ryswick concluded in September 1697 restored Pondicherry to the French, the Dutch garrison held on to it for two more years. Once again, under Francois Martin\u2019s able guidance, Pondicherry flourished and turned out to be the most important settlement of the French in India. Again there was a bad turn in the fortunes of the French company in India when the War of Spanish Succession broke out in Europe. Consequent to this, they had to abandon their factories at Surat, Masulipatnam, and Bantam in the early 18th century. The French in India had another setback when Francois Martin died on December 31, 1706. Reorganisation of the French Company In 1720, the French company was reorganised as the \u2018Perpetual Company of the Indies\u2019 which revived its strength.

Further, the French India was backed by the French possession of Mauritius and Reunion in the southern Indian Ocean. The Anglo-French Struggle for Supremacy: the Carnatic Wars Background of Rivalry Though the British and the French came to India for trading purposes, they were ultimately drawn into the politics of India. Both had visions of establishing political power over the region. The Anglo-French rivalry in India reflected the traditional rivalry of England and France throughout their histories; it began with the outbreak of the Austrian War of Succession and ended with the conclusion of the Seven Years\u2019 War. Specifically in India, the rivalry, in the form of three Carnatic wars, decided once for all that the English and not the French were to become masters of India. In 1740, the political situation in south India was uncertain and confused. ","46":"In 1740, the political situation in south India was uncertain and confused. Nizam Asaf Jah of Hyderabad was old and fully engaged in battling the Marathas in the western Deccan while his subordinates were speculating upon the consequences of his death. To the south of his kingdom lay the Coromandel Coast without any strong ruler to maintain a balance of power. Instead, there was the remnant of the old Vijayanagara empire in interior Mysore, Cochin, and Travancore on the Malabar Coast, and in the east the small states of Madura (Madurai), Tanjore (Thanjavur), and Trichinopoly (Thiruchirapally). The decline of Hyderabad was the signal for the end of Muslim expansionism and the English adventurers got their plans ready. Also, there was the Maratha kingdom of Tanjore, providing the Peshwa of Pune an excuse for interference whenever he pleased. First Carnatic War (1740\u201348) Background Carnatic was the name given by the Europeans to the Coromandel Coast and its hinterland. ","47":"The First Carnatic War was an extension of the Anglo-French War\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b Advent of the Europeans in India 45 in Europe which was caused by the Austrian War of Succession.Immediate Cause Although France, conscious of its relatively weaker position in India, did not favour an extension of hostilities to India, the English navy under Barnet seized some French ships to provoke France. France retaliated by seizing Madras in 1746 with the help of the fleet from Mauritius, the Isle of France, under Admiral La Bourdonnais, the French governor of Mauritius. Thus began the first Carnatic War. Result The First Carnatic War ended in 1748 when the Treaty of Aix-La Chapelle was signed, bringing the Austrian War of Succession to a conclusion. Under the terms of this treaty, Madras was handed back to the English, and the French, in turn, got their territories in North America. Significance The First Carnatic War is remembered for the Battle of St. Thome (in Madras) fought between the French forces and the forces of Anwaruddin, the Nawab of Carnatic, to whom the English appealed for help. ","48":"A small French army under Captain Paradise defeated the strong Indian army under Mahfuz Khan at St. Thome on the banks of the River Adyar. This was an eye-opener for the Europeans in India: it revealed that even a small disciplined army could easily defeat a much larger Indian army. Further, this war adequately brought out the importance of naval force in the Anglo-French conflict in the Deccan. Second Carnatic War (1749\u201354) Background The background for the Second Carnatic War was provided by rivalry in India. Dupleix, the French governor who had successfully led the French forces in the First Carnatic War, sought to increase his power and French political influence in southern India by interfering in local dynastic disputes to defeat the English. Immediate Cause The opportunity was provided by the death of Nizam-ul-Mulk, the founder of the independent kingdom of Hyderabad, in 1748, and the release of Chanda Sahib, the son-in-law of Dost Ali, the Nawab of Carnatic,\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 46 A Brief History of Modern India by the Marathas in the same year. ","49":"The accession of Nasir Jung, the son of the Nizam, to the throne of Hyderabad was opposed by Muzaffar Jung, the grandson of the Nizam, who laid claim to the throne saying that the Mughal Emperor had appointed him as the governor of Hyderabad. In the Carnatic, the appointment of Anwaruddin Khan as the Nawab was resented by Chanda Sahib. The French supported the claims of Muzaffar Jang and Chanda Sahib in the Deccan and Carnatic, respectively, while the English sided with Nasir Jang and Anwaruddin. Course of the War The combined armies of Muzaffar Jang, Chanda Sahib, and the French defeated and killed Anwaruddin at the Battle of Ambur (near Vellore) in 1749. Muzaffar Jang became the subahdar of Deccan, and Dupleix was appointed governor of all the Mughal territories to the south of the River Krishna. A French army under Bussy was stationed at Hyderabad to secure French interests there. ","50":"A French army under Bussy was stationed at Hyderabad to secure French interests there. Territories near Pondicherry and also some areas on the Orissa coast (including Masulipatnam) were ceded to the French.Having failed to provide effective assistance to Muhammad Ali at Trichinopoly, Robert Clive, then an agent (\u2018factor\u2019) of the English company, put forward the proposal for a diversionary attack on the governor of Madras, Saunders. He suggested a sudden raid on Arcot, the capital of the Carnatic, so as to relieve the pressure on Trichinopoly. He reasoned that in such an event Chanda Sahib would rush to save his capital. Thus, in August 1751, with only a force of 210 men, Robert Clive attacked and captured Arcot. As expected, Chanda Sahib hastened to his capital, taking a force of 4,000 men from Trichinopoly, but failed to get back the fort even after a siege of 53 days, from September 23 to November 14. Now Mysore, Tanjore, and the Maratha chief, Morari Rao, came to the aid of Trichinopoly, and of Clive and Stringer Lawrence. Trichinopoly was first relieved of its siege, while General Law of France with Chanda Sahib remained cooped up in the island of Srirangam.

He got a high post at Pondicherry in 1720, allegedly on the basis of influence of his father. At Pondicherry, he made a lot of money by private trade, which was then permitted to servants of the French company. In December 1726, he was suspended owing to drastic change in the constitution of the French company and some confusions arising out of that. In 1730, Dupleix won his case, and was appointed as governor of Chandernagore as compensation. In 1741, he was appointed as the Director-General of French colonies in India. Later, he was conferred the title of Nawab by the Mughal emperor and the subahdar of Deccan, Muzzaffar Jang. ","52":"Later, he was conferred the title of Nawab by the Mughal emperor and the subahdar of Deccan, Muzzaffar Jang. According to historians, Dupleix possessed qualities of an administrator, a diplomat, and a leader besides having political insight with a broad vision. Dupleix in the Role of Administrator In 1741, Dupleix became the Governor, General of Pondicherry. He found Pondicherry facing several problems\u2014Maratha invasion, famine, uncultivated land, and chaotic conditions in the Carnatic. Apart from these, the Directors of the Company sought a drastic cut in expenditure of the French East India Company, owing to the priority given to the French colonies in North America. So, Dupleix reduced public expenditure, despite opposition from his council, and balanced income and expenditure, coupled with a cut on salaries of officers. However, he decided to disobey the directors on the matter of fortification of settlements. He enhanced the defences of Pondicherry, even spending a large sum from his personal wealth. He made Pondicherry the emporium of commerce in south India by taking practical steps to develop the trade of the colony. ","53":"He made Pondicherry the emporium of commerce in south India by taking practical steps to develop the trade of the colony. Later, the Directors of the Company praised Dupleix for taking the right decisions, even in contradiction of the directors. Dupleix as a Master of Diplomacy The analysis of the first two Carnatic wars proves the diplomacy of Dupleix as a leader who visualised the path of the European conquest of India. Dupleix used the Nawab of Carnatic to forbid the English from waging war in his territories so that the French settlements at Pondicherry could be protected till the French forces acquired enough strength. In return, the nawab was promised Madras after the English got defeated. But Dupleix, using his diplomacy, did\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 48 A Brief History of Modern India not give Madras to the nawab and even defeated him at St. Thome (1746).Dupleix convinced Admiral La Bourdonnais to break promises made to the English, citing examples from history that promises made under certain circumstances were never binding. ","54":"Further, he said that since the position of the governor general was superior to that of the commander of navy, the compact entered into between the latter and the English was ultra vires. Thus, he was able to convince his subordinate to do what was considered unethical in general terms, but best suited for one\u2019s nation. Dupleix was the first European to interfere in the internal politics of the Indian rulers. He supported Muzzaffar Jang for Hyderabad and Chanda Sahib for Carnatic, and his candidates emerged successful and, in return, gave great concessions to Dupleix.Dupleix was, in fact, the originator of the practice of subsidiary alliance in India. He placed a French army at Hyderabad at the expense of the subahdar. Why Dupleix Failed in India Dupleix was recalled in 1754 due to the initial defeat of the French army in the Second Carnatic War and the heavy cost incurred by the company due to Dupleix\u2019s political decisions. Many historians have called the recall of Dupleix by the directors as a blunder\u2014a result of a compromise between France and England over issues in America. ","55":"Many historians have called the recall of Dupleix by the directors as a blunder\u2014a result of a compromise between France and England over issues in America. However, there were some weaknesses in Dupleix also, which can be put in brief as follows: (i) Dupleix suffered from an over-sanguine temperament. He hoped too often for too long, thus losing the advantage in critical situations. (ii) The peers of Dupleix did not like his autocratic behaviour and on many occasions quarrelled with him on this matter. (iii) Dupleix was not a man of action: he planned a campaign, directed his lieutenants, but never led an army in the battlefield like Lawrence or Clive. The French failed to capture Trichinopoly (1752\u201353) because the schemes thought out by Dupleix could not be turned into action by his commanders. Result The French authorities, annoyed at the heavy financial losses that Dupleix\u2019s policy involved, decided to recall him in 1754. Godeheu succeeded Dupleix as the French governor general in India. Godeheu adopted a policy of negotiations with the English and concluded a treaty with them.

According to historians, the fear of serious repercussions in America prompted the French to suspend hostilities in India. Implications It became evident that the countenance of Indian authority was no longer necessary for European success; rather Indian authority itself was becoming dependent on European support. Muhammad Ali in the Carnatic and Salabat Jang in Hyderabad became clients rather than patrons. Third Carnatic War (1758\u201363) Background In Europe, when Austria wanted to recover Silesia in 1756, the Seven Years\u2019 War (1756\u201363) started. Britain and France were once again on opposite sides. Course of War in India In 1758, the French army under Count de Lally captured the English forts of St. David and Vizianagaram. ","58":"Now, the English became offensive and inflicted heavy losses on the French fleet under Admiral D\u2019Ache at Masulipatnam.\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 50 A Brief History of Modern India Battle of Wandiwash The decisive battle of the Third Carnatic War was won by the English on January 22, 1760 at Wandiwash (or Vandavasi) in Tamil Nadu. General Eyre Coote of the English totally routed the French army under Count Thomas Arthur de Lally and took Bussy as prisoner. Pondicherry was gallantly defended by Lally for eight months before he surrendered on January 16, 1761. With the loss of Jinji and Mahe, the French power in India was reduced to its lowest. Lally, after being taken as prisoner of war at London, returned to France where he was imprisoned and executed in 1766. Result and Significance The Third Carnatic War proved decisive. Although the Treaty of Peace of Paris (1763) restored to the French their factories in India, the French political influence disappeared after the war. ","59":"Thereafter, the French, like their Portuguese and Dutch counterparts in India, confined themselves to their small enclaves and to commerce. The English became the supreme European power in the Indian subcontinent, since the Dutch had already been defeated in the Battle of Bidara in 1759. The Battle of Plassey, in 1757, is usually regarded by historians as the decisive event that brought about ultimate British rule over India. However, one cannot quite ignore the view that the true turning point for control of the subcontinent was the victory of British forces over the French forces at Wandiwash in 1760. The victory at Wandiwash left the English East India Company with no European rival in India. View While the English received supplies of food and money from Bengal, recruits of men from Europe, and grain from their northern settlements, the French could receive nothing but what came to them laboriously by land. The first were constantly strengthened, the second was constantly weakened. ","60":"And this enabled Coote to establish his military superiority over Lally in the field and to hem him within the walls of Pondicherry. \u2014H.H. Dodwell (The Cambridge History of India, Vol V)\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b Advent of the Europeans in India 51 Thus, they were ready to take over the rule of the entire country.Significantly, in the Battle of Wandiwash, natives served in both the armies as sepoys. It makes one think: irrespective of which side won, there was an inevitability about the fall of India to European invaders. There was a lack of sensitivity to geopolitics of the day as well as a lack of foresight on the part of native rulers. Causes for the English Success and the French Failure The English company was a private enterprise\u2014this created a sense of enthusiasm and self-confidence among the people. With less governmental control over it, this company could take instant decisions when needed without waiting for the approval of the government. The French company, on the other hand, was a State concern. ","61":"The French company, on the other hand, was a State concern. It was controlled and regulated by the French government and was hemmed in by government policies and delays in decision-making. The English navy was superior to the French navy; it helped to cut off the vital sea link between the French possessions in India and France. The English held three important places, namely, Calcutta, Bombay, and Madras, whereas the French had only Pondicherry.The French subordinated their commercial interest to territorial ambition, which made the French company short of funds.In spite of their imperialistic motives, the British never neglected their commercial interests. So, they always had the funds and the consequent sound financial condition to help them significantly in the wars against their rivals. A major factor in the success of the English in India was the superiority of the commanders in the British camp. ","62":"Other much desired fabrics were the painted cloths and prints, the silks, and the dyes. These textiles were not just in demand in Europe but also in other parts of Asia. Indians had traded in textiles for centuries before the Europeans arrived. In China, Japan, and the Indonesian archipelago, Indian cotton was popular for its light weight, yet strong qualities. When the Dutch, English, and French acquired materials from India, it was not only for their home countries, but for transport to Malacca or Java, for example, where they were traded for spices. ","63":"By the 18th century, the French had coloured patterned handkerchiefs specially woven for particular island markets, which proved a successful entrepreneurial effort. A corollary to the trade in textiles and spices was the trade in slaves. It is generally considered that slave trade concerned Europe, Africa, and the Americas (the \u2018New World\u2019), but this ignores the fact that trade between Europe and Asia also helped to sustain slavery. French ships took European goods to Asia, where they acquired cowry shells and Indian textiles that were highly valued in West Africa. Traders exchanged these goods in Africa for slaves, who were sent to the colonies of France in the Americas. \u201cThe circle was completed,\u201d says the Yale Center for the Study of Globalisation, \u201cwhen sugar and other goods from the Americas were loaded on board and shipped back to France.\u201d When the French East India Company started trading in India, they entered an already well-established, complex economic system, an intricate network of production, negotiation, delivery, and distribution. ","64":"Large commercial fleets as well as prosperous shore-based businesses were run by Indian merchants. Weavers and merchants worked with overland freight operators and brokers, who worked with exporters and ship owners. These agents had also to negotiate with local state officials for commercial privileges. The European traders had to learn well-established rules and practices and successfully collaborate with indigenous envoys. The factories of all the European trading groups were to be found in practically the same places. At the peak of the Indian trade, the demand for Indian goods exceeded the supply by weavers and other artisans; even so there was no serious rivalry initially.\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b Advent of the Europeans in India 53 But as the three companies\u2014the Dutch, the English, and the French\u2014grew more competitive, the English, better funded and better conversant in local business practices and customs, were able to expand their factory outposts to larger industrial towns under their jurisdiction. ","65":"Gradually, these commercial strongholds turned into political enclaves, ultimately enabling the English to expand and consolidate their power and control all over India. The Danes The Danish East India Company was established in 1616, and in 1620, they founded a factory at Tranquebar near Tanjore, on the eastern coast of India. Their principal settlement was at Serampore near Calcutta. The Danish factories, which were not important at any time, were sold to the British government in 1845. The Danes are better known for their missionary activities than for commerce. Why the English Succeeded against Other European Powers Of all the European nations who came as traders to India after new sea routes were discovered, England emerged as the most powerful and successful by the end of the 18th century. ","66":"Structure and Nature of the Trading Companies The English East India Company, formed through amalgamation of several rival companies at home, was controlled by a board of directors whose members were elected annually. The shareholders of the company exercised considerable influence, as the votes could be bought and sold through purchase of shares. The trading companies of France and Portugal were largely owned by the State, and their nature was in many ways feudalistic.\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 54 A Brief History of Modern India In the French company, the monarch had more than 60 per cent share and, its directors were nominated by the monarch from the shareholders who were supposed to carry out the decisions of two high commissioners appointed by the government. The shareholders took very little interest in promoting the prosperity of the company, because the State guaranteed a dividend to the shareholders. ","67":"The lack of public interest could be inferred from the fact that between 1725 and 1765, there was no meeting of the shareholders and the company was simply managed as a department of the State. Naval Superiority The Royal Navy of Britain was not only the largest, it was the most advanced of its times. The victory against the Spanish Armada and against the French at Trafalgar had put the Royal Navy at the peak of the European naval forces. In India too, the British were able to defeat the Portuguese and the French due to strong and fast movement of the naval ships. The English learnt from the Portuguese the importance of an efficient navy and improved their own fleet technologically. Industrial Revolution The Industrial Revolution started in England in the early 18th century, with the invention of new machines like the spinning Jenny, steam engine, the power loom, and several others. These machines greatly improved production in the fields of textiles, metallurgy, steam power, and agriculture. ","68":"These machines greatly improved production in the fields of textiles, metallurgy, steam power, and agriculture. The industrial revolution reached other European nations late, and this helped England to maintain its hegemony. Military Skill and Discipline The British soldiers were a disciplined lot and well-trained. The British commanders were strategists who tried new tactics in warfare. Technological developments equipped the military well. All this combined to enable smaller groups of English fighters defeat larger armies. Stable Government With the exception of the Glorious Revolution of 1688, Britain witnessed stable government with efficient monarchs.\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b Advent of the Europeans in India 55 Other European nations like France witnessed violent revolution in 1789 and afterwards the Napoleonic Wars. Napoleon\u2019s defeat in 1815 significantly weakened France\u2019s position, and from then on it was forced to side with Britain. The Italians got united as a nation as late in 1861. The Dutch and Spain were also involved in the 80-years war in the 17th century, which weakened Portuguese imperialism. ","69":"The Dutch East India Company, affected by bankruptcy in 1800 coupled with the revolution in 1830, was forced to sell its possessions to Britain and quit Asia. Lesser Zeal for Religion Britain was less zealous about religion and less interested in spreading Christianity, as compared to Spain, Portugal, or the Dutch. Thus, its rule was far more acceptable to the subjects than that of other colonial powers. Use of Debt Market One of the major and innovative reasons why Britain succeeded between the mid-18th century and the mid-19th century, while other European nations fell, was that it used the debt markets to fund its wars. The world\u2019s first central bank\u2014 the Bank of England\u2014was established to sell government debt to the money markets on the promise of a decent return on Britain\u2019s defeating rival countries like France and Spain. Britain was thus enabled to spend much more on its military than its rivals. ","70":"Britain\u2019s rival France could not match the expenditure of the English; between 1694 and 1812, first under the monarchs, then under the revolutionary governments, and finally under Napoleon Bonaparte, France simply went bankrupt with its outdated ways of raising money. Summary Why a Sea Route to India (i) Spirit of renaissance in the 15th-century Europe (ii) European economy growing rapidly, leading to prosperity and demand for luxury goods; increase in the supply of meat requiring spices for preservation\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 56 A Brief History of Modern India (iii) Capture of Constantinople in 1453, and Syria and Egypt later by the Ottoman Turks calling for a new route to reach India without dealing with Arabs and Turks (iv) Venice and Genoa too small to stand up to the Turks (v) Spain and Portugal aided with money and men by the North Europeans and by ships and technical knowledge by the Genoese (vi) The Portuguese the pioneers, followed by the Dutch, English, Danes, and the French respectively to reach India The Portuguese Vasco Da Gama discovered sea route to India in 1498. ","71":"Vasco\u2019s second visit in 1502 led to the establishment of trading stations at Calicut, Cochin, and Cannanore. Francisco de Almeida (1505\u201309) First governor, initiated the blue water policy (cartaze system). Alfonso de Albuquerque (1509\u20131515) Considered to be the founder of the Portuguese power in India: captured Goa from Bijapur; persecuted Muslims; captured Bhatkal from Sri Krishna Deva Rai (1510) of Vijayanagara; and initiated the policy of marrying with the natives of India and banned the practice of sati in his area of influence. Nino da Cunha (1529\u201338) shifted the capital from Cochin to Goa in 1530. In his rule, Diu and Bassein came under the Portuguese occupation from Gujarat King Bahadur Shah. Bahadur Shah got killed in 1537 at Diu while negotiating with the Portuguese.

Settlements in India (i) With Captain Thomas Best\u2019s victory over the Portuguese (1612), the English established their first factory at Surat (1613). Subsequently, Sir Thomas Roe secured permission from Jehangir to establish factories at Agra, Ahmedabad, and Broach. (ii) Bombay came under the control of the Company, with Charles II (who received it as a part of the Portuguese dowry) leasing it out to the English Company for an annual rent of 10 pounds. ","74":"(iii) Madras with the Fort St. George replaced Masulipatnam as the English headquarters on the east coast, when the former was given by the Chandragiri chief to the English in 1639. (iv) The city of Calcutta grew from the development of three villages Sutanuti, Gobindapur, and Kalikata secured from the Mughal governor of Bengal. The fortified settlement was named Fort William (1700), and it became the seat of British power in India till 1911. Farrukhsiyar\u2019s Farmans In 1717, the Mughal Emperor Farrukhsiyar\u2019s farmans, called Magna Carta of the East India Company, gave significant privileges to the Company in Bengal, Gujarat, and Hyderabad. Merger of Companies In 1635, a rival company named Courteen\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 58 A Brief History of Modern India Association later called the Assada company, formed by Sir William Courteen, was given license to trade by Charles I. In 1657, both the companies merged. In 1698, another rival company emerged. ","75":"This Company ruled in India till 1858. The French Foundation In 1664, Colbert, a minister of Louis XIV, laid the foundations of Compagnie des Indes Orientales. Settlements in India Pondicherry, developed as headquarters, was granted to Francois Martin, the director of Masulipatnam factory, by Valikondapuram governor Sher Khan Lodi in 1673.

Alfonso de Albuquerque Albuquerque, who succeeded Almeida as the Portuguese governor in India, was the real founder of the Portuguese power in the East, a task he completed before his death. He secured for Portugal the strategic control of the Indian Ocean by establishing bases overlooking all the entrances to the sea. . \n    In the context given above, Re-write the following chunk in two paragraphs.

"},"summary":{"0":"History is a continuous process, and it is not always easy to distinguish when one period ends and another begins. The history of modern India began with the arrival of the Europeans in the 15th century, even before the Mughals established their empire. The decline of the Roman Empire in the 7th century led to a decline in direct contact between Europe and India, affecting the accessibility of Indian commodities like spices, calicoes, silk, and precious stones. Constantinople fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453, further impacting trade.","1":"After the fall of Constantinople in 1453, Arab Muslim intermediaries controlled the trade routes to India. The Europeans, eager to find a direct sea route to India, made great advances in ship-building and navigation. They wanted to reach the unknown corners of the East and meet the demand for oriental luxury goods, which increased with the economic development of many regions of Europe.","2":"As prosperity grew in Europe, so did the demand for luxury goods from the East. Venice and Genoa were too small to compete with the Ottoman Turks, but the north Europeans were ready to aid Portugal and Spain with money and men. Portugal took on the leadership in resisting Islam and exploring new routes to India, with Prince Henry of Portugal leading the way as an obsessed navigator.","3":"Prince Henry of Portugal was obsessed with finding a sea route to India to bypass Muslim domination of the Mediterranean. Pope Nicholas V gave him permission to navigate to India, but he died before it could happen. In 1497, Portugal and Spain divided the non-Christian world between them, with Portugal claiming everything to the east of an imaginary line in the Atlantic. Portuguese navigator Bartholomew Dias rounded the Cape of Good Hope in 1487, and ten years later, an expedition of Portuguese ships arrived in India in May 1498.","4":"The arrival of Vasco Da Gama's three ships in Calicut in May 1498 changed Indian history. The Hindu ruler welcomed him, but Arab traders were worried about Portuguese dominance. The Indian Ocean trading system had many participants, but none sought overwhelming dominance.","5":"The Portuguese wanted to control the profitable eastern trade by excluding competitors, especially the Arabs. Vasco da Gama stayed in India for three months and returned to Portugal with a rich cargo, selling it at a huge profit. Other European merchants were tempted to come to India and trade directly. Pedro Alvarez Cabral negotiated and established a factory at Calicut in September 1500, but there was an incident of conflict resulting in the death of several Portuguese.","6":"In response to the Portuguese factory attack, Cabral seized Arab merchant ships and bombarded Calicut. He later made treaties with Cochin and Cannanore. When Vasco da Gama returned in 1501, he sought to exclude Arab merchants, but faced resistance from the Zamorin due to his hostility towards them. The landing of da Gama in 1498 marked a new era in world history.","7":"The Portuguese wanted to weaken their enemies, the Muslims, Arabs, and Turks, by finding a new sea-route to India. They hoped to break the monopoly of the Arabs and Turks over the trade in eastern goods and explore Africa to find the legendary Prester John, who they believed would help them attack the Muslims from two sides.","8":"The Portuguese had multiple objectives in opening a sea-route to India. They wanted to weaken the Muslims, Arabs, and Turks who were enemies of Christianity and posed a threat to Europe. They also aimed to break the monopoly of the Arabs and Turks over the trade in eastern goods and hoped to find Prester John's kingdom to attack the Muslims from two sides. The Portuguese set up trading factories at Cannanore, Calicut, and Cochin, and gradually got permission to fortify these centres. Francisco De Almeida was appointed as governor to consolidate their position and destroy Muslim trade by seizing Aden, Ormuz, and Malacca.","9":"Francisco De Almeida was appointed as the governor of India by the King of Portugal in 1505. He was tasked with consolidating the Portuguese position in India and destroying Muslim trade. He was also advised to build fortresses at various trade centres. However, he faced opposition from the Zamorin and a threat from the Mameluke Sultan of Egypt. In 1507, the Portuguese squadron was defeated in a naval battle off Diu, but Almeida avenged his defeat the next year. Alfonso de Albuquerque succeeded Almeida and established bases overlooking all the entrances to the Indian Ocean, securing strategic control for Portugal.","10":"Albuquerque established Portuguese bases in East Africa, off the Red Sea, at Ormuz, in Malabar, and at Malacca. He introduced a permit system for other ships and controlled major ship-building centers. Albuquerque acquired Goa from the Sultan of Bijapur in 1510 and abolished sati. However, his policy of persecuting Muslims was a drawback.","11":"Albuquerque persecuted Muslims to eliminate their commercial interests in the East. He strengthened Goa's fortifications and encouraged Portuguese men to take Indian wives to establish a permanent population. They became landlords, introduced new crops, and settled as artisans and traders, considering their new settlements as home.","12":"Nino da Cunha became governor of Portuguese interests in India in 1529 and moved the government headquarters to Goa a year later. Bahadur Shah of Gujarat gave the Portuguese the island of Bassein and promised them a base in Diu in 1534, but their relationship soured when Humayun withdrew from Gujarat in 1536. The Portuguese killed the ruler of Gujarat in 1537 after negotiations failed.","13":"In the Deccan, kingdoms were forming as the Bahmani Kingdom broke up. None of them had strong navies. The Chinese emperor limited the reach of Chinese ships, and Arab merchants had no match for the Portuguese organization and unity. The Portuguese had cannons on their ships, making them a formidable force. The Estado Portugu\u00eas da India was a significant element in Indian history, occupying around sixty miles of coast around Goa.","14":"Within fifty years of Vasco da Gama's arrival, the Portuguese had control over many coastal parts of India. They occupied around sixty miles of coast around Goa and controlled a narrow tract with four important ports and hundreds of towns and villages on the west coast. In the south, they had a chain of seaport fortresses and trading-posts like Mangalore, Cannanore, Cochin, and Calicut. They also established military posts and settlements on the east coast and in West Bengal, and signed treaties with the Deccan sultans.","15":"The Portuguese played a role in battles for power in India. They were the first and last Europeans to come to India, leaving in 1961. The viceroy was the head of administration, with a council and Vedor da Fazenda. Fortresses were under captains and factors. The Portuguese had conflicts with Moors and Arabs.","16":"The Portuguese wanted to promote Christianity and persecute Muslims in the East. They were initially tolerant towards Hindus, but later persecuted them too. However, the Jesuits made a good impression at the court of Akbar, who was interested in theology. Akbar invited two priests from Goa to convert him and his court to Christianity. Jesuit fathers, Rodolfo Aquaviva and Antonio Monserrate, were selected for the purpose.","17":"The Jesuits were invited by Akbar to convert him and his court to Christianity. Aquaviva and Monserrate were selected for the purpose and were received with honour when they reached Fatehpur Sikri. However, their mission failed and the hopes of the Portuguese were belying. The third mission arrived in 1595 and became a sort of permanent institution, extending its influence on secular politics.","18":"The Jesuits were allowed to keep the church and priests' residence in Lahore. In 1608, the priests baptized people in Agra and hoped to convert Jahangir to Christianity, but their hopes were dashed. The Portuguese viceroys' arrogance caused a rift with the Mughal emperor. Captain William Hawkins arrived in Surat with a letter from King James I, requesting permission to do business in India. Despite the Portuguese authorities' efforts to stop him, Hawkins met with Jahangir and conversed with him in Turki.","19":"Hawkins spoke Turki with Jahangir and was appointed as a mansabdar of 400 with a salary of Rs 30,000. He married Mubarikesha, daughter of an Armenian Christian. The Portuguese were offended by the grant of trading facilities to the English, but a truce was established after negotiations. Hawkins left the Mughal court in 1611, unable to counter the Portuguese intrigues. In November 1612, the English ship Dragon successfully fought a Portuguese fleet, impressing Jahangir. The Portuguese acts of piracy resulted in conflict with the Mughal government.","20":"The Portuguese piracy caused conflict with the Mughal government. In 1613, they captured Mughal ships, imprisoned Muslims, and plundered cargoes. Jahangir ordered compensation, but it was during Shah Jahan's reign that the Portuguese lost their advantages in the Mughal court. They also lost hope of converting the royal family to Christianity. \n\nThe Portuguese settled on a river bank near Satgaon in Bengal for trading. They built big buildings and the trade moved to the new port of Hooghly.","21":"The Portuguese controlled salt production, built their own custom house, and enforced tobacco taxes strictly. They also engaged in a cruel slave trade, taking Hindu and Muslim children as slaves. In 1632, the Mughal siege of Hooghly began, leading to the capture of the city three months later. The Portuguese fled, and the Mughals took 400 prisoners who were given the choice to convert to Islam or become slaves. The persecution of Christians continued for some time before gradually dying down.","22":"By the 18th century, the Portuguese lost their commercial influence in India. Some continued trade individually, while others turned to piracy and robbery. Hooghly was used as a base for piracy in the Bay of Bengal. The decline was due to the emergence of powerful dynasties in Egypt, Persia, and North India, the rise of the Marathas, and their religious policies, trade practices, and piracy.","23":"The Portuguese became sea pirates and were disliked by rulers and the Mughals. Portugal's focus shifted to Brazil and they were dragged into Spain's wars. The Dutch and English learned the sea route to India, ending Portuguese trade monopoly.","24":"With the arrival of new European traders in India, competition grew fierce. The Portuguese, with their limited resources, were unable to compete with the more powerful Dutch and English. These new competitors had greater resources and a stronger drive to expand overseas, ultimately overcoming Portuguese resistance.","25":"Goa lost its importance as a port after the fall of the Vijayanagara empire. The Dutch controlled the spice trade and Brazil became the new economic center of Portugal's overseas empire. In 1683, the Marathas invaded Goa. The Portuguese marked the emergence of naval power in India and gained monopoly over trade with the use of force.","26":"The Portuguese ships had cannons, which helped them gain a monopoly over trade through force. They did not follow any rules and wanted to dominate the Indian Ocean trading system. They also showed military innovation on land, such as using body armour and guns, and introduced drilling groups of infantry, which was later adopted by other armies in India. The Portuguese were skilled at sea and improved techniques in naval power.","27":"The Portuguese ships were strong and had many decks, allowing them to carry heavy weapons. They used castles on the front and back to defend against boarding. They also had good organization, with royal arsenals and a system of pilots and mapping. The Portuguese taught the Mughals and Marathas, but the Dutch and English learned the most. The Portuguese also taught art in India.","28":"The Portuguese missionaries and Church were also teachers and patrons of the arts in India, including painting, carving, and sculpture. They introduced European art to India and helped the art of silversmith and goldsmith flourish in Goa. However, the churches built by the Portuguese were generally simple in their architectural plan. The Dutch also arrived in India and founded their first factory in Masulipatnam in 1605, after forming the East India Company of the Netherlands in 1602.","29":"After arriving in India, the Dutch established their first factory in Masulipatnam in 1605. They then set up trading centers in different parts of India, becoming a threat to the Portuguese. They captured Nagapatam and made it their main stronghold in South India. The Dutch also established factories in Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Bengal, and Bihar, and participated in the redistributive trade, carrying various articles and merchandise from India to the islands of the Far East.","30":"The English challenged the Dutch in the Eastern trade, leading to warfare. The rivalry peaked at Amboyna, where the Dutch massacred ten Englishmen and nine Japanese in 1623. After prolonged warfare, both parties agreed to a compromise in 1667. The Dutch retired from India to focus on their more profitable trade in Indonesia, monopolising the trade in black pepper and spices. The Dutch traded in silk, cotton, indigo, rice, and opium in India, but got drawn into the trade of the Malay Archipelago, leading to their decline in India.","31":"The Dutch shifted their focus to the Malay Archipelago, leading to their decline in India. In the third Anglo-Dutch War, communication between Surat and Bombay was cut, resulting in the capture of English ships by the Dutch in the Bay of Bengal.","32":"The English defeated the Dutch in the Battle of Hooghly in November 1759, which ended Dutch ambitions in India. The Dutch were more interested in trade than empire building in India, and their main focus was on the Spice Islands of Indonesia. The English were encouraged to venture out to the East after Francis Drake's voyage and the English victory over the Spanish Armada. In 1600, Queen Elizabeth I issued a charter to the 'Governor and Company of Merchants of London trading into the East Indies' for exclusive trading rights.","33":"Initially, the English East India Company had a monopoly of 15 years, which was extended indefinitely in May 1609. As the Dutch focused on the East Indies, the English turned to India for textiles and other trade commodities. Captain Hawkins arrived in India in 1609, but the attempt to establish a factory at Surat failed due to Portuguese opposition. The English began trading at Masulipatnam in 1611 and established a factory there in 1616. In 1612, Captain Thomas Best defeated the Portuguese in the sea off Surat, and Jahangir allowed the English to establish a factory at Surat in early 1613.","34":"In 1615, Sir Thomas Roe came to the court of Jahangir as an ambassador of James I. He secured permission to set up factories at Agra, Ahmedabad, and Broach. The English company faced competition from the Portuguese and the Dutch, but the situation changed in their favor. Bombay was gifted to King Charles II by the King of Portugal and later given to the East India Company in 1668. Bombay became the headquarters in 1687, and there was peace between the English and the Portuguese.","35":"The Dutch agreed not to interfere with the English company's trade in India, improving their position. The English received the 'Golden Farman' from the Sultan of Golconda in 1632, allowing them to trade freely in Golconda's ports. They built a fortified factory at Madras in 1639 and extended their trading activities to Hariharpur and Balasore. They also gained a foothold in Bengal, a large and prosperous province in India.","36":"The English merchants were interested in controlling Bengal for trade and profit. The subahdar of Bengal, Shah Shuja, allowed them to trade in Bengal for an annual payment of Rs 3,000. The English started factories in Hooghly, Kasimbazar, Patna, and Rajmahal. However, customs officers sometimes obstructed their business. The English wanted a fortified settlement at Hooghly for protection, but their appeal to the Mughal governor was unsuccessful, leading to hostilities.","37":"Hostilities broke out between the English and the Mughals after an appeal for redressal of grievances was unsuccessful. The Mughals sacked Hooghly in 1686, and the English retaliated by capturing imperial forts. However, they were forced to leave Hooghly and negotiate with the Mughals to establish a factory at Sutanuti in 1691.","38":"A zamindar named Sobha Singh rebelled, giving the English a reason to fortify their settlement at Sutanuti in 1696. In 1698, they bought the zamindari of Sutanuti, Gobindapur, and Kalikata for Rs 1,200. The fortified settlement was named Fort William in 1700 and became the seat of the eastern presidency with Sir Charles Eyre as its first president. In 1715, the Company secured three farmans from the Mughal emperor Farrukhsiyar, giving them many valuable privileges in Bengal, Gujarat, and Hyderabad.","39":"The English East India Company gained trading concessions in Bengal through flattery and diplomacy. They were allowed to issue passes for goods transportation and rent more lands around Calcutta. In Hyderabad, they were exempted from duties in trade and had to pay rent only for Madras. In Surat, they paid an annual fee of 10,000 rupees to be exempted from all duties. The coins minted by the Company in Bombay were decreed to have currency throughout the Mughal empire. The Company established a permanent factory in Surat in 1613.","40":"In 1613, the East India Company established a permanent factory in Surat. Two years later, Sir Thomas Roe arrived at Jahangir's court and obtained two farmans confirming free trade with exemption from inland tolls. The Company also established its first factories in Masulipatnam and Hariharpur, Balasore, and obtained the golden farman from the Sultan of Golconda. In 1639, the Company got the lease of Madras and in 1651, permission to trade at Hooghly. In 1662, Charles II was given Bombay as dowry and in 1667, Aurangzeb gave the English a farman for trade in Bengal. In 1691, the Company got the imperial order to continue their trade in Bengal.","41":"In 1717, the Mughal emperor Farrukhsiyar gave the East India Company many trade concessions through a farman called Magna Carta of the Company. This helped the Company to become more powerful and gain control over India. After the English revolution of 1688, a rival company was formed, but it failed. In 1708, the two companies were merged to form the East India Company, which ruled India from 1708 to 1873.","42":"The French established the Compagnie des Indes Orientales in 1664, with a 50-year monopoly on trade in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. The company was granted a concession in perpetuity for Madagascar and any other territories it could conquer. Francois Caron set up a factory in Surat in 1667 and Mercara founded another in Masulipatnam in 1669.","43":"Mercara founded a French factory in Masulipatnam in 1669 with a patent from the Sultan of Golconda. In 1673, the French obtained permission from Shaista Khan to establish a township at Chandernagore near Calcutta. Pondicherry was founded in 1674 and became the stronghold of the French in India. The French also established factories in other coastal regions.","44":"Pondicherry was the stronghold of the French in India. However, the outbreak of war between the Dutch and the French badly affected the French position in India. The Dutch captured Pondicherry in 1693, but it was restored to the French in 1697. The War of Spanish Succession caused the French to abandon their factories in Surat, Masulipatnam, and Bantam. Francois Martin's death in 1706 was another setback. The French company was reorganised as the 'Perpetual Company of the Indies' in 1720, which revived its strength.","45":"The French company regained strength under Lenoir and Dumas, who were wise governors from 1720 to 1742. French India was supported by the French possession of Mauritius and Reunion in the southern Indian Ocean. The Anglo-French Struggle for Supremacy: the Carnatic Wars began with the outbreak of the Austrian War of Succession and ended with the conclusion of the Seven Years\u2019 War.","46":"In 1740, the political situation in south India was uncertain. The Nizam Asaf Jah of Hyderabad was old and busy fighting the Marathas, while his subordinates were unsure of what would happen after his death. The Coromandel Coast had no strong ruler, and there were small states in the east. The decline of Hyderabad marked the end of Muslim expansionism, and the English were ready to take advantage. The Maratha kingdom of Tanjore also provided an excuse for interference. This led to the First Carnatic War (1740-48), fought over control of the Coromandel Coast.","47":"The First Carnatic War was caused by the Anglo-French War in Europe. The English provoked France by seizing their ships, leading to France taking Madras in 1746. The war ended in 1748 with the Treaty of Aix-La Chapelle, returning Madras to the English. The Battle of St. Thome was a significant event in the war.","48":"During the First Carnatic War, a small French army led by Captain Paradise defeated a larger Indian army at St. Thome, revealing the effectiveness of disciplined European armies. The importance of naval force in the Anglo-French conflict was also highlighted. The Second Carnatic War (1749-54) was caused by French governor Dupleix's desire to increase French influence in southern India by interfering in local disputes, which was made possible by the death of Nizam-ul-Mulk and the release of Chanda Sahib by the Marathas.","49":"After the death of Nizam-ul-Mulk, a dispute arose between his son Nasir Jung and grandson Muzaffar Jung over the throne of Hyderabad. In the Carnatic, Anwaruddin Khan was appointed Nawab, but Chanda Sahib opposed it. The French supported Muzaffar Jung and Chanda Sahib, while the English supported Nasir Jung and Anwaruddin. The combined forces of Muzaffar Jung, Chanda Sahib, and the French defeated Anwaruddin at the Battle of Ambur in 1749. Muzaffar Jung became the subahdar of Deccan, and Dupleix was appointed governor of all Mughal territories south of the River Krishna. A French army under Bussy was stationed at Hyderabad to secure French interests.","50":"To secure their interests, the French stationed an army under Bussy in Hyderabad and were ceded territories near Pondicherry and Masulipatnam. Robert Clive proposed a diversionary attack on Madras governor Saunders by capturing Arcot, the capital of the Carnatic. Chanda Sahib failed to recapture the fort after a 53-day siege, and Trichinopoly was relieved with the aid of Mysore, Tanjore, and Maratha chief Morari Rao. General Law of France and Chanda Sahib remained cooped up in Srirangam.","51":"Trichinopoly was relieved of its siege with the help of Mysore, Tanjore, and Maratha chief Morari Rao. General Law of France and Chanda Sahib surrendered in June 1752 after Muhammad Ali executed Chanda Sahib, with no interference from the British.","52":"Dupleix was appointed as the Director-General of French colonies in India and later conferred the title of Nawab. He was known for his administrative, diplomatic, and leadership qualities. As the Governor-General of Pondicherry, he faced several challenges such as Maratha invasion, famine, and chaotic conditions in the Carnatic. Despite opposition, he reduced public expenditure and balanced income and expenditure. He also enhanced the defences of Pondicherry and made it the emporium of commerce in south India.","53":"Dupleix made Pondicherry a hub of trade in south India by developing its commerce. Despite opposition, he fortified the settlement and balanced income and expenditure. The Directors praised him for his decisions. Dupleix used diplomacy to protect French settlements and defeat the English. He promised the nawab Madras but did not give it to him, and convinced Admiral La Bourdonnais to break promises made to the English.","54":"Dupleix convinced his subordinate to break promises made to the English, citing historical examples. He interfered in Indian politics, supporting Muzzaffar Jang and Chanda Sahib, and originated the practice of subsidiary alliance. However, he was recalled in 1754 due to the initial defeat of the French army and the cost incurred by the company. Historians consider it a blunder, resulting from a compromise between France and England over issues in America.","55":"Many historians believe that Dupleix's recall was a mistake due to a compromise between France and England over issues in America. However, Dupleix had weaknesses, including his over-sanguine temperament, autocratic behavior, and lack of action. The French failed to capture Trichinopoly because Dupleix's plans could not be executed. The French authorities recalled him in 1754 due to heavy financial losses. Godeheu succeeded him and adopted a policy of negotiations with the English, concluding a treaty with them.","56":"Godeheu became the new French governor general in India after Dupleix was recalled in 1754. He negotiated with the English and signed a treaty with them, agreeing not to interfere in each other's affairs in India.","57":"Godeheu made a treaty with the English and they agreed not to interfere in the quarrels of native princes. Each party kept the territories they occupied. The French suspended hostilities in India due to fear of repercussions in America. Indian authority became dependent on European support. In 1758, the French captured English forts of St. David and Vizianagaram.","58":"After the French captured English forts, the English retaliated and defeated the French fleet at Masulipatnam. The English won the decisive battle of the Third Carnatic War at Wandiwash in 1760, which reduced French power in India. The Treaty of Peace of Paris restored French factories in India, but their political influence disappeared.","59":"After defeating the French fleet at Masulipatnam, the English became the dominant European power in India. The Battle of Wandiwash in 1760 was a turning point, as the English defeated the French army and took control of their territories. The French, Portuguese, and Dutch were confined to their small enclaves and focused on commerce, while the English became the supreme power in the subcontinent.","60":"Coote's military superiority over Lally led to the French being confined to Pondicherry. The Battle of Wandiwash saw natives fighting on both sides, highlighting the inevitability of India falling to European invaders. The English company's private enterprise allowed for quick decision-making, while the French company's state concern hindered their success.","61":"The French company was controlled by the government, causing delays in decision-making. The English navy was superior, cutting off the French sea link. The English held Calcutta, Bombay, and Madras, while the French only had Pondicherry. The French prioritized territorial ambition over commercial interests, leading to a lack of funds. The British never neglected their commercial interests, maintaining sound financial conditions. The English had superior commanders, a major factor in their success.","62":"Desirable fabrics like painted cloths, prints, silks, and dyes were in demand not only in Europe but also in other parts of Asia. Indian cotton was popular in China, Japan, and the Indonesian archipelago for its light weight and strength. The Dutch, English, and French acquired materials from India not only for their home countries but also for trading in Malacca or Java for spices.","63":"In the 18th century, the French made coloured handkerchiefs for specific island markets, which was a successful business. The trade in textiles and spices also led to the trade in slaves. French ships took European goods to Asia, where they acquired cowry shells and Indian textiles that were highly valued in West Africa. Traders exchanged these goods in Africa for slaves, who were sent to the colonies of France in the Americas.","64":"Indian merchants ran large commercial fleets and shore-based businesses, working with weavers, freight operators, and brokers. European traders had to learn established rules and practices and collaborate with indigenous envoys, negotiating with local officials for commercial privileges. At the peak of Indian trade, demand exceeded supply, but as competition grew, the English were able to expand their factories to larger towns under their jurisdiction.","65":"The English, Dutch, and French merchants worked with Indian weavers and brokers to export goods. The English, with better funding and knowledge of local customs, expanded their factories to larger towns, turning them into political enclaves. The Danish East India Company established factories but were not successful and sold them to the British in 1845. England emerged as the most powerful European nation in India by the end of the 18th century.","66":"The English East India Company was controlled by a board of directors elected annually, with shareholders having considerable influence. In contrast, the trading companies of France and Portugal were largely owned by the State, with shareholders taking little interest in promoting prosperity.","67":"The French company was largely owned by the State, with the monarch having over 60% share. Shareholders took little interest in promoting the company's prosperity as the State guaranteed a dividend. Between 1725 and 1765, there was no meeting of shareholders and the company was managed as a department of the State. \n\nThe British Royal Navy was the largest and most advanced of its time, defeating the Spanish Armada and French at Trafalgar. In India, the British defeated the Portuguese and French due to their strong and fast naval ships. The English learned from the Portuguese the importance of an efficient navy and improved their own fleet technologically. \n\nThe Industrial Revolution began in England in the early 18th century with the invention of new machines like the spinning Jenny, steam engine, power loom, and others. These machines greatly improved production in textiles, metallurgy, steam power, and agriculture.","68":"The Industrial Revolution improved production in textiles, metallurgy, steam power, and agriculture. England's early start in the revolution helped it maintain its dominance. British soldiers were well-trained and disciplined, with innovative commanders and advanced technology. Stable government also contributed to England's success. Other European nations faced revolutions and wars, weakening their positions.","69":"The Dutch East India Company sold its possessions to Britain and left Asia due to bankruptcy and revolution. Britain's less zealous approach to religion made its rule more acceptable to subjects than other colonial powers. Britain's use of debt markets, through the Bank of England, allowed it to fund its wars and spend more on its military than its rivals, contributing to its success during the industrial revolution.","70":"Britain's success in Asia was due to its less zealous approach to religion and innovative use of debt markets to fund its wars. France, on the other hand, went bankrupt due to outdated ways of raising money. The need for a sea route to India arose due to the spirit of renaissance, growing European economy, capture of Constantinople by the Ottoman Turks, and the inability of Venice and Genoa to stand up to the Turks. The Portuguese were the pioneers, followed by the Dutch, English, Danes, and the French. Vasco Da Gama discovered the sea route to India in 1498.","71":"Vasco Da Gama established trading stations in Calicut, Cochin, and Cannanore during his second visit in 1502. Francisco de Almeida (1505-09) initiated the cartaze system and Alfonso de Albuquerque (1509-1515) captured Goa and persecuted Muslims. Nino da Cunha (1529-38) shifted the capital to Goa and occupied Diu and Bassein from Gujarat King Bahadur Shah.","72":"The Dutch formed the United East India Company in 1602 with the power to wage wars, make treaties, and build forts. They established trading stations in India and competed with the Portuguese for control.","73":"The English East India Company was formed on December 31, 1600, after Drake's voyage and the defeat of the Spanish Armada. They were given a monopoly to trade in the East Indies for 15 years by Queen Elizabeth I. Captain Thomas Best's victory over the Portuguese led to the establishment of the first English factory at Surat in 1613. Sir Thomas Roe secured permission to establish factories at Agra, Ahmedabad, and Broach. Bombay came under the control of the Company, with Charles II leasing it out for an annual rent of 10 pounds.","74":"(iii) The English headquarters on the east coast moved to Madras with the establishment of Fort St. George in 1639. (iv) Calcutta grew from three villages secured from the Mughal governor of Bengal and became the seat of British power in India until 1911. In 1717, the Mughal Emperor Farrukhsiyar\u2019s farmans gave significant privileges to the English East India Company.","75":"The Company ruled India until 1858. In 1664, the French Compagnie des Indes Orientales was founded by Colbert. Pondicherry was granted to Francois Martin in 1673 and was finally incorporated into the Indian Union in 1954. The Anglo-French rivalry in India was caused by the protection and expansion of commercial interests and political developments. The First Carnatic War (1740-48) was an extension of the Anglo-French rivalry in Europe and ended with the Treaty of Aix-La Chapelle.","76":"The Second Carnatic War happened from 1749 to 1754 and weakened the French in South India compared to the English. The Third Carnatic War was a significant battle, including the Battle of Wandiwash in 1760-61, and was a reflection of the Anglo-French conflict in Europe. The Treaty of Paris in 1763 allowed the French to use Indian settlements for trade only and prohibited fortification of settlements."},"story_prompt":{"0":"Context:Modern History of India: A summaryUNIT 2 Advent of Europeans and Consolidation of British Power in India Chapters 3 to 5 CHAPTER 3 Advent of the Europeans in India Though we talk of ancient, medieval, and modern periods in history, history is a continuity. \n    In the context given above, Re-write the following chunk in, two paragraphs, without losing any factual information in a story and fable format, but don't start with \"once upon a time\".

However, Prince Henry died before his dream could become a reality.

Under the treaty, Portugal could claim and occupy everything to the east of the line while Spain could claim everything to the west. The situation was thus prepared for the Portuguese incursions into the waters around India.

When he returned to Portugal, he carried back with him a rich cargo and sold the merchandise in the European market at a huge profit. The importance of direct access to the pepper trade was made clear by the fact that elsewhere the Europeans, who had to buy through Muslim middlemen, would have had to spend ten times as much for the same amount of pepper. Not surprisingly, other profit-seeking merchants of European nations were tempted to come to India and trade directly. A voyage was undertaken by Pedro Alvarez Cabral to trade for spices; he negotiated and established a factory at Calicut, where he arrived in September 1500.

"},"story":{"0":"Long ago, there was a time when India was ruled by different people. It is hard to say when one period ended and another began. But, if we start with the arrival of the Europeans, we have to go back to the 15th century. Even before the Mughals came to power. \n\nAt that time, the Arabs controlled the trade routes to India. The Europeans found it hard to get Indian goods like spices, silk, and precious stones. But, in 1453, the Ottoman Turks took over Constantinople. This made it even harder for the Europeans to trade with India.","1":"Long ago, the Ottomans took over Constantinople and controlled the trade routes to India. The Europeans had to rely on Arab Muslim traders to get Indian goods, but they wanted a direct sea route. They built better ships and explored the unknown corners of the East. They also needed spices for cooking and preservation, and the demand for luxury goods grew with prosperity.","2":"As Europe prospered, so did the desire for exotic goods from the East. Venice and Genoa were too small to compete with the Ottoman Turks, but the north Europeans were eager to help Portugal and Spain. Portugal led the way in resisting Islam and exploring new lands, with Prince Henry the Navigator obsessed with finding a sea route to India and bypassing Muslim control.","3":"Long ago, Prince Henry of Portugal had a dream to find a new way to reach India. He wanted to trade with the people there and spread the Christian faith. The Pope gave him permission to sail across the sea to India, but Prince Henry died before he could make the journey. Later, Portugal and Spain divided the world between them, and Portugal set out to find the sea route to India. A brave navigator named Bartholomew Dias sailed around the southern tip of Africa and believed he had found the way. Ten years later, a group of Portuguese ships set sail for India and arrived there in less than a year.","4":"Long ago, a prince named Henry dreamed of sailing to far-off lands to spread his faith. But he passed away before he could make it happen. Later, two countries divided the world between them, with Portugal claiming the east and Spain the west. A Portuguese navigator named Bartholomew Dias found a sea route to India, and ten years later, Vasco Da Gama arrived in India with three ships. The Hindu ruler welcomed him, but Arab traders were worried about the Portuguese taking over the trading system in the Indian Ocean.","5":"The Portuguese wanted to control the eastern trade and make lots of money. Vasco da Gama stayed in India for three months and sold his cargo for a big profit in Europe. Other Europeans wanted to come to India and trade too. Pedro Alvarez Cabral came to Calicut and set up a factory, but there was a fight and some Portuguese died.","6":"After Vasco da Gama's successful trip to India, the Portuguese wanted to control the trade and exclude the Arabs. Pedro Alvarez Cabral arrived in Calicut to trade for spices, but there was conflict and he attacked Arab ships. Later, he made treaties with local rulers. Vasco da Gama returned, but the Zamorin refused to exclude the Arabs. Vasco da Gama became hostile and attacked Arab shipping. This marked a new era in world history.","7":"The Portuguese wanted to find a new way to India to hurt their enemies, the Muslims, Arabs, and Turks. They wanted to take over the trade in spices and find a Christian ruler called Prester John. They hoped to attack the Muslims from two sides and become very powerful.","8":"The Portuguese wanted to find a new way to reach India and take control of the spice trade. They also wanted to defeat their enemies, the Muslims, Arabs, and Turks. They hoped to find a Christian ruler named Prester John and attack the Muslims from two sides. Vasco da Gama set up a trading factory in Cannanore and the Portuguese gradually became powerful. They built fortresses to protect their trade and appointed a governor, Francisco De Almeida, to destroy Muslim trade and build more fortresses. He said that being powerful at sea was more important than having fortresses on land.","9":"When Francisco De Almeida became the governor of India, he wanted to make the Portuguese the rulers of the Indian Ocean. He built fortresses in Cannanore, Kilwa, and other places to protect their trading activities. But he faced a threat from the Mameluke Sultan of Egypt, who wanted to stop the Portuguese. In a naval battle off Diu, Almeida's son was killed, but the next year, Almeida avenged his defeat and crushed the two navies. Almeida's vision was known as the Blue Water Policy. \n\nAfter Almeida, Alfonso de Albuquerque became the governor of India. He wanted to make Portugal the most powerful country in the East. He established bases overlooking all the entrances to the sea, securing strategic control of the Indian Ocean. Albuquerque completed this task before his death and became the real founder of Portuguese power in the East.","10":"Albuquerque, a Portuguese governor, wanted to make his country the master of the Indian Ocean. He built strongholds in East Africa, Malabar, and Malacca. He controlled ship-building centers and introduced a permit system for other ships. He even acquired Goa from the Sultan of Bijapur in 1510. However, his policy of persecuting Muslims was a drawback.","11":"Albuquerque wanted to help his countrymen by getting rid of Muslim businesses in the East. He made Goa stronger and more important for trade. He also told his men to marry Indian women so they could stay in India forever. The Portuguese men became landlords, built new things, and grew new crops. They loved their new home in India.","12":"When Nino da Cunha became governor of Portuguese interests in India, he moved the government headquarters to Goa. Bahadur Shah of Gujarat gave the Portuguese the island of Bassein and promised them a base in Diu. But when Humayun left Gujarat, the people of the town fought with the Portuguese. The ruler of Gujarat was invited to a Portuguese ship and killed in 1537.","13":"In the Deccan, there were many small kingdoms. None of them had strong ships, and they didn't try to make their navy better. The Chinese emperor said his ships couldn't go far. Arab merchants and ship-owners couldn't match the Portuguese. The Portuguese had cannons on their ships. \n\nThe Portuguese State was important in Indian history. They controlled many coastal parts of India within fifty years of Vasco da Gama's arrival. They had taken over about sixty miles of coast around Goa.","14":"Long ago, the Portuguese arrived in India led by Vasco da Gama. They quickly gained control of many coastal areas, including a sixty-mile stretch around Goa. They had four important ports and many towns and villages under their control. They also had a chain of seaport fortresses and trading-posts in the south. The Portuguese even established military posts and settlements on the east coast and in West Bengal. They made treaties with the Deccan sultans and exchanged envoys with many kingdoms in India.","15":"Long ago, the Portuguese came to India and took control of many coastal areas. They had important ports and trading-posts, and even had influence over local rulers. They also established settlements on the east coast. The Portuguese were involved in many battles for power in India and were the last Europeans to leave. The head of their administration was the viceroy, and they had a religious policy that made enemies of the Moors and Arabs. In 1961, the Government of India recaptured Goa, Daman and Diu from them.","16":"Long ago, the Portuguese came to the East with a strong desire to spread Christianity. They did not like the Muslims, who were their enemies in North Africa. At first, they were kind to the Hindus, but later they became cruel to them too. However, the Jesuits made a good impression on the Mughal emperor Akbar, who was interested in theology. He invited two priests to his court, hoping to learn more about Christianity. The Jesuits were happy to go and spread their faith.","17":"When the Jesuit fathers Aquaviva and Monserrate arrived in Fatehpur Sikri, they were welcomed with respect. But their hope of converting Emperor Akbar to Christianity was not fulfilled. Two more missions were sent, but they too failed. The third mission, led by Fathers Xavier and Pinheiro, stayed in Lahore and became influential in politics. Jahangir, who became the new emperor, initially ignored the Jesuits but later allowed them to keep their church and residence.","18":"The Jesuit priests were allowed to keep their church in Lahore and even baptized people in Agra. They hoped to convert Jahangir to Christianity, but it didn't happen. The Portuguese also caused problems with the Mughal emperor. Captain Hawkins from England was able to meet Jahangir and do business with him, despite the Portuguese's efforts to stop him.","19":"Hawkins spoke the Turki language and talked with Jahangir without an interpreter. Jahangir liked him and made him a mansabdar of 400 with a salary of Rs 30,000. Hawkins married Mubarikesha, an Armenian Christian's daughter. The Portuguese were angry with the English trading facilities, but they made peace with the Mughal emperor. Hawkins left in 1611, but in 1612, Captain Best fought and won against the Portuguese. Jahangir was impressed, and the Portuguese piracy caused problems with the Mughal government.","20":"The Portuguese were causing trouble by stealing from Mughal ships and hurting Muslims. Jahangir was angry and ordered compensation. But it was Shah Jahan who finally stopped the Portuguese from having too much power in the Mughal court. The Portuguese had hoped to convert the royal family to Christianity, but that dream was lost. Meanwhile, the Portuguese had built big buildings in Hooghly and moved their trade there.","21":"Long ago, the Portuguese came to a land called Mughal India. They traded and made money, but they also did bad things. They took Hindu and Muslim children and made them Christians. They even took two girls from a very important family. The Mughal leader, Shah Jahan, was very angry and ordered his soldiers to capture the Portuguese city of Hooghly. After three months, they succeeded and the Portuguese had to leave. Some soldiers were taken as prisoners and given a choice to become Muslim or slaves. The bad things the Portuguese did to the people of Mughal India stopped after this.","22":"Long ago, the Portuguese came to India and became very rich by trading salt and tobacco. But they also did bad things, like taking Hindu and Muslim children as slaves. They even took two girls from Mumtaz Mahal! The Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan, was angry and attacked the Portuguese in Hooghly. After a long fight, the Portuguese had to leave. Later, they lost their power because other countries became stronger and people didn't like their bad behavior.","23":"Long ago, the Portuguese came to India with swords and crosses. They found gold and forgot about the crosses, filling their pockets instead. They became pirates and made enemies with rulers and the Mughals. They also tried to convert Hindus to Christianity, which made them angry. The Dutch and English learned the sea route to India, ending Portuguese trade monopoly. Portugal also got involved in Spain's wars and discovered Brazil, so they left India.","24":"The Portuguese were once sea pirates who were known for their arrogance and violence. They came to India with a sword in one hand and a crucifix in the other, but soon forgot about the crucifix when they found gold. However, their monopoly of trade in India was challenged by the Dutch and the English, who were also learning the skills of ocean navigation. These new competitors had greater resources and overcame the Portuguese resistance, leading to a fierce rivalry among them. In the end, the Portuguese had to give way to the more powerful and enterprising competitors.","25":"Long ago, when new traders from Europe came to India, they fought fiercely for power. The Portuguese were strong, but the Dutch and English were even stronger. They took over the spice trade and Goa lost its importance. The Marathas invaded Goa in 1683. The Portuguese were the first foreign power to come to India by sea, and they used their ships and cannons to gain control of trade.","26":"Long ago, a foreign power arrived in India by way of the sea. They were called the Portuguese and their ships carried powerful weapons called cannon. The Portuguese wanted to control trade and declared they would follow their own rules. They used their weapons to gain an advantage over the Indians and the Indian Ocean trading system. The Portuguese also showed military innovation on land, teaching others how to drill infantry and use guns. They were masters of improved techniques at sea.","27":"The Portuguese ships were strong and had many levels, with big guns to protect them. They had special parts at the front and back to stop enemies from getting on board. The Indians copied these ideas. The Portuguese were also good at planning and had special places to make and fix their ships. They taught other Europeans how to do this too. The Portuguese also helped Indian artists, but some people remember them for being mean to different religions.","28":"The Portuguese were great sailors who built strong ships to withstand storms. They also had powerful weapons to protect themselves from enemies. They taught Indians how to make beautiful art and music. The Dutch were also good sailors and formed a company to trade and fight wars. They built their first factory in Masulipatnam.","29":"Long ago, the Dutch sailed to India and built their first factory in Masulipatnam. They made many trading centers and became a threat to the Portuguese. They captured Nagapatam and made it their main stronghold in South India. They built factories in many places like Surat, Bengal, and Bihar. They traded many things like indigo, textiles, and opium.","30":"Long ago, the Dutch came to India and set up trading centres in many places. They became a threat to the Portuguese and even captured their stronghold in South India. They traded many things like indigo, textiles, and rice. But then, the English also came to trade in the East and this made the Dutch very angry. They even had a big fight in a place called Amboyna. After many years of fighting, they made a deal. The British left Indonesia and the Dutch left India to focus on trading spices in Indonesia. The Dutch slowly stopped trading in India and started trading in the Malay Archipelago instead.","31":"The Dutch were once powerful in India, but they became greedy and wanted more. They went to the Malay Archipelago to trade, but this made them weak. They fought with the English and captured their ships. But, in the end, they lost their power and had to leave India.","32":"The Dutch and English were rivals in India. The Dutch wanted to trade and colonize the East Indies, while the English wanted a share of the profits. In a battle, the English defeated the Dutch, crushing their ambitions in India. The Dutch were more interested in trading spices from Indonesia, where they made a lot of money. The English formed a company to trade in the East Indies, with exclusive rights granted by Queen Elizabeth I.","33":"Long ago, the Dutch were not interested in ruling India, but they loved to trade. They made a lot of money from the Spice Islands in Indonesia. The English saw this and wanted to join in. They formed a company called the 'Governor and Company of Merchants of London trading into the East Indies' in 1600. They were given a monopoly for 15 years, which was extended indefinitely in 1609. They tried to set up a factory in Surat, but the Portuguese stopped them. They succeeded in Masulipatnam in 1611 and Surat in 1613.","34":"Sir Thomas Roe went to meet Jahangir, the Mughal emperor, in 1615. He stayed there for four years but couldn't make a trade deal. However, he got permission to set up factories in Agra, Ahmedabad, and Broach. The English company had a tough time with the Portuguese and Dutch, but things changed. Bombay was gifted to King Charles II, and later, the East India Company got it for a small fee. Bombay became the headquarters in 1687, and there was peace between the English and Portuguese.","35":"Long ago, the English company faced many challenges in India. They had to compete with the Portuguese and the Dutch for trade. But things changed when Bombay was gifted to King Charles II and later given to the English company. They also received a special permission to trade in Golconda and built a fortified factory in Madras. They even started trading in Bengal, a rich province in India. With the help of these privileges, the English company became successful in India.","36":"The English merchants wanted to control Bengal's trade and politics. The governor, Shah Shuja, agreed to let them trade for Rs 3,000 a year. They started factories in Hooghly, Kasimbazar, Patna, and Rajmahal. But sometimes, customs officers asked for tolls. The English wanted a fortified settlement in Hooghly, but the Mughal governor, Shaista Khan, didn't help. So, the English and Mughals fought.","37":"After the English appealed for help, the Mughals refused to listen. This led to a fight between the two groups. Four years later, the Mughals attacked and destroyed Hooghly. The English fought back by capturing Mughal forts and raiding their territories. However, they were forced to leave Hooghly and move to an unhealthy location. Later, they negotiated with the Mughals and returned to Sutanuti, where they established a factory and paid Rs 3,000 a year. A zamindar's rebellion gave them the chance to fortify their settlement in 1696.","38":"After returning to Sutanuti, the English faced rebellion from a zamindar named Sobha Singh. This gave them the chance to fortify their settlement in 1696. Two years later, they bought the zamindari of Sutanuti, Gobindapur, and Kalikata for Rs 1,200. The fortified settlement was named Fort William in 1700 and became the seat of the eastern presidency with Sir Charles Eyre as its first president.\n\nIn 1715, John Surman led an English mission to the court of Mughal emperor Farrukhsiyar. They secured three farmans that gave the Company many valuable privileges in Bengal, Gujarat, and Hyderabad. The farmans exempted the Company's imports and exports from additional customs duties, allowed them to issue passes for transportation of goods, and permitted them to rent more lands around Calcutta. These farmans were regarded as the Magna Carta of the Company.","39":"Long ago, the English East India Company came to India to trade. They were allowed to transport goods with special passes called dastaks. They were also allowed to rent more land around Calcutta. In Hyderabad, they didn't have to pay trade duties and only had to pay rent for Madras. In Surat, they paid 10,000 rupees each year to be exempt from all duties. The coins they made in Bombay were accepted all over the Mughal empire.\n\nThe English were very clever and used flattery and diplomacy to get these trading concessions from the Mughal authority. But they had to defeat the French first. The East India Company was established in 1600 and in 1609, William Hawkins arrived at Jahangir's court. Captain Middleton got permission to trade in Surat in 1611 and in 1613, the East India Company set up a permanent factory there.","40":"In 1613, the East India Company made a permanent factory in Surat. Two years later, Sir Thomas Roe, the ambassador of King James I, arrived at Jahangir's court and got two farmans for free trade. The Company also established factories in Masulipatnam, Hariharpur, and Madras. They got permission to trade in Hooghly and Bengal, and even got Bombay as dowry. The Company continued their trade in Bengal by paying Rs 3,000 a year.","41":"Once upon a time, a powerful emperor named Farrukhsiyar issued a special paper called Magna Carta for the Company. This paper gave the Company many trade benefits. The Company was very happy because they could now control all the trade in India and become very rich.\n\nBut, there was another group of English people who did not like the Company having all the power. They formed a new company and sent Sir William Norris to talk to the emperor. However, this new company did not do well. So, the two companies joined together in 1708 to become the East India Company. This Company became very powerful and ruled India for many years.","42":"Long ago, the French wanted to trade in the East, but they were the last Europeans to come to India. King Louis XIV helped create the Compagnie des Indes Orientales in 1664, which had a 50-year monopoly on French trade in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. The Company tried to revive colonies in Madagascar, but failed. In 1667, Francois Caron set up a factory in Surat and Mercara founded another in Masulipatnam in 1669.","43":"Long ago, the French wanted to trade with the East, but they were the last to arrive in India. They started a company called Compagnie des Indes Orientales and tried to conquer Madagascar, but it didn't work. In 1667, Francois Caron went to India and set up a factory in Surat. Mercara, a Persian, started another factory in Masulipatnam in 1669. Later, the French established a township at Chandernagore and founded Pondicherry in 1674. Francois Martin became the governor and developed it as a place of importance.","44":"Long ago, the French came to India and built a strong place called Pondicherry. But they faced troubles when the Dutch attacked and took over. After many years, the French got Pondicherry back and it became even stronger. But then, a big war in Europe made them leave some of their other places in India. When their leader Francois Martin died, they were sad. But later, they reorganised and became strong again.","45":"In the land of India, the French had a strong fort called Pondicherry. But they faced many challenges, like when the Dutch took over the fort. However, a wise leader named Francois Martin helped the French regain control. Later, the French company was reorganized and became strong again with the help of two governors named Lenoir and Dumas. They also had support from the French colonies in Mauritius and Reunion. \n\nThe British and French both came to India for trade, but they wanted power too. They fought many wars, called the Carnatic wars, to decide who would rule India. The English won and became the masters of India. This rivalry started with the Austrian War of Succession and ended with the Seven Years\u2019 War. In 1740, the situation in south India was confusing.","46":"In south India, the situation was uncertain and confusing in 1740. The old ruler of Hyderabad was busy fighting the Marathas, and his subordinates were worried about what would happen when he died. There were small states in the east and remnants of the old Vijayanagara empire in the interior. The English saw an opportunity when Hyderabad declined, and the Marathas interfered whenever they pleased. This led to the first Carnatic War (1740-48) over control of the Coromandel Coast.","47":"Long ago, there was a land called Carnatic, ruled by many small kingdoms. The Europeans came to India and fought a big war in their own land. The English wanted to fight in India too, so they took some French ships. The French got angry and took over Madras with the help of their navy. This started the first Carnatic War. The war ended when a treaty was signed, giving Madras back to the English. The war is remembered for the Battle of St. Thome.","48":"Long ago, there was a battle at St. Thome between the French and Indian armies. Captain Paradise led a small French army to victory over the strong Indian army under Mahfuz Khan. This showed the Europeans that even a small, disciplined army could defeat a much larger Indian army. The importance of naval force in the Anglo-French conflict in the Deccan was also revealed. \n\nLater, there was another war called the Second Carnatic War. The French governor, Dupleix, wanted to increase his power and French political influence in southern India by interfering in local dynastic disputes to defeat the English. When Nizam-ul-Mulk, the founder of the independent kingdom of Hyderabad, died in 1748, and Chanda Sahib, the son-in-law of Dost Ali, the Nawab of Carnatic, was released by the Marathas, the opportunity for war arose.","49":"In the land of India, there was a great rivalry between the French and the English. The French governor, Dupleix, wanted to increase his power and influence by interfering in local disputes. When the founder of Hyderabad died, Dupleix saw an opportunity to support Muzaffar Jang's claim to the throne against Nasir Jung. In the Carnatic, the French supported Chanda Sahib against Anwaruddin Khan. The French and their allies won the Battle of Ambur, and Muzaffar Jang became the subahdar of Deccan. Dupleix was appointed governor of all the Mughal territories to the south of the River Krishna, and a French army was stationed at Hyderabad to secure their interests.","50":"The French army was sent to Hyderabad to protect their interests. The French were given some territories near Pondicherry and Masulipatnam. Robert Clive suggested attacking Arcot to divert Chanda Sahib's attention from Trichinopoly. With only 210 men, Clive captured Arcot. Chanda Sahib failed to recapture the fort even after a 53-day siege. Mysore, Tanjore, and Morari Rao helped Clive and Stringer Lawrence. Trichinopoly was relieved, while Chanda Sahib was trapped on the island of Srirangam.","51":"After the victory at Arcot, Trichinopoly was saved from siege. General Law and Chanda Sahib were trapped on an island and surrendered when Muhammad Ali executed Chanda Sahib. Meanwhile, Joseph Francis Dupleix, a wealthy man, became governor of Chandernagore and Director-General of French colonies in India. He even became a Nawab.","52":"Dupleix was a clever man with many talents. He became the Governor of Pondicherry and faced many problems, like famine and chaos. He reduced spending and balanced the budget, but he also disobeyed the directors and spent his own money to make Pondicherry stronger. He even made it a great place for trade. The Mughal emperor and subahdar of Deccan, Muzzaffar Jang, were so impressed that they gave him the title of Nawab.","53":"Dupleix was a great leader who made Pondicherry a hub of trade in south India. He worked hard to develop the colony's commerce and even spent his own money to make it stronger. The Directors of the Company were happy with his decisions, even when they disagreed. Dupleix was also a master of diplomacy. He used the Nawab of Carnatic to protect Pondicherry from the English and promised him Madras in return. But Dupleix was clever and didn't give Madras to the nawab. He even defeated him in battle and convinced Admiral La Bourdonnais to break promises made to the English.","54":"Dupleix was a wise leader who knew how to make his colony prosper. He made Pondicherry a great place for trade and commerce. He even convinced the Nawab of Carnatic to help protect the French settlements. Dupleix was very clever and used his diplomacy to make sure the French were successful. He even supported certain Indian rulers and created a new way of forming alliances. Sadly, Dupleix was eventually recalled because of the cost of his decisions. Some people think this was a mistake, but it was really because of issues between France and England.","55":"Dupleix was a clever man who interfered in Indian politics. He helped Muzzaffar Jang and Chanda Sahib become rulers and they gave him many gifts. Dupleix even made a new kind of alliance called a \"subsidy alliance\". But he was too hopeful and his friends didn't like his bossy ways. He never fought in battles and his plans didn't work. The French lost money and recalled him in 1754. A new governor named Godeheu made peace with the English.","56":"Godeheu became the new French governor in India after Dupleix. He talked with the English and they made a promise not to interfere in each other's affairs. This was a peaceful solution to the struggle between France and England for power in India.","57":"Long ago, two powerful kingdoms, England and France, fought for control of a faraway land called India. A man named Dupleix led the French, while a man named Clive led the English. They fought many battles, but eventually the English won. The French and English made a treaty, promising not to interfere in the quarrels of the Indian princes. The French kept the land they already had, and the English kept theirs. The Indians realized they needed the help of the Europeans to succeed. The French and English continued to fight in other parts of the world, but their war in India was over. \n\nLater, when Austria wanted to recover a land called Silesia, a big war called the Seven Years' War started. The French and English were on opposite sides again. In India, the French captured two English forts, but the English fought back and won. The war lasted for many years, but eventually the English became the most powerful in India.","58":"After capturing English forts, the French were defeated by the English at Wandiwash. General Eyre Coote led the English army to victory and took Count Thomas Arthur de Lally as prisoner. The French power in India decreased and Lally was executed. The Treaty of Peace of Paris restored French factories, but their political influence vanished.","59":"After defeating the French at Wandiwash, the English became the most powerful European force in India. The French, Portuguese, and Dutch stayed in their small areas and focused on trade. The English received support from Bengal and had a constant supply of food and money, while the French struggled to get supplies. This victory was a turning point in British rule over India.","60":"Long ago, Europeans came to India to trade and rule. The English became the strongest, defeating the Dutch and French. They won a big battle at Wandiwash, leaving no rivals. The English had food, money, and men, while the French had nothing. This made the English stronger and the French weaker. Coote won against Lally and trapped him in Pondicherry. The natives fought on both sides, but India fell to the Europeans because of native rulers' lack of foresight. The English company was private and confident, while the French company was controlled by the government.","61":"In a far-off land, two companies came to conquer. The French company was controlled by the government, which made it slow to make decisions. The English company was free to act quickly, which gave them an advantage. The English navy was strong and cut off the French from their home country. The English had three important places, while the French only had one. The French cared more about land than money, which left them short of funds. The English were smart and always kept their commercial interests in mind. They had great leaders who helped them win.","62":"Long ago, people loved colorful fabrics like painted cloths, silks, and dyes. Indians had been trading these textiles for many years. Even in faraway places like China and Japan, people loved Indian cotton for its lightness and strength. When the Dutch, English, and French got these fabrics from India, they didn't just keep them for themselves. They traded them for spices in places like Malacca and Java.","63":"In the 18th century, the French made special handkerchiefs with colorful patterns for different islands. This was a smart business move. But, there was a dark side to the textile and spice trade. Slavery was a part of it. French ships went to Asia to get cowry shells and Indian textiles. They traded these for slaves in Africa, who were then sent to the French colonies in the Americas. The circle was complete when goods from the Americas were sent back to France. The French East India Company was part of a complex economic system in India.","64":"In India, many merchants worked together to run big businesses. They made things like cloth and spices and sold them to other countries. The European traders had to learn how to work with the Indian merchants and follow their rules. At first, there was enough for everyone, but as more companies came, the English became the most successful. They knew how to work with the Indians and grew bigger and bigger.","65":"Long ago, Indian merchants ran big fleets and businesses with the help of weavers and brokers. European traders had to learn the rules and work with locals to succeed. The English were the best at this and expanded their factories to bigger towns. They became so powerful that they controlled all of India. The Danes also came, but they were not successful and sold their factories to the British. The English succeeded because they knew how to work with the locals and other traders.","66":"Long ago, many traders from Europe came to India to trade. The English formed a big company, controlled by a board of directors elected every year. Shareholders had a lot of power, as they could buy and sell votes. The French and Portuguese companies were owned by the State, and the monarch had a big share. Shareholders didn't care much about the company's success, as the State promised them money. The English company became the most powerful and successful.","67":"In the land of trading companies, there were three different types. The English East India Company was controlled by a board of directors elected every year. The French and Portuguese companies were owned by the State and had little interest in promoting prosperity. The British had the strongest navy, which helped them defeat their enemies in India. They also started the Industrial Revolution with new machines that improved production.","68":"Long ago, England was a powerful nation. They had the biggest and most advanced navy in Europe, which helped them win battles against other countries. They also had new machines that made things like clothes and metal faster and better than anyone else. This made England very rich and powerful, and other countries couldn't catch up because they were too slow to start using these machines. \n\nEngland also had very good soldiers who were well-trained and disciplined. Their commanders were very smart and came up with new ways to fight in battles. They also had good weapons and technology that helped them win even when they were outnumbered. England also had a stable government with good leaders, which helped them stay strong while other countries were having problems. This is how England became so powerful and stayed that way for a long time.","69":"Long ago, there were many powerful countries in Europe. They had big armies and wanted to control other lands. One country, called Britain, was very good at fighting. Their soldiers were well-trained and their commanders were smart. They also had new machines that helped them make things faster. \n\nBritain was also lucky because they had stable leaders who were good at ruling. They didn't have many big problems like other countries did. They also didn't try to force their religion on other people, so the people they ruled over were happier. \n\nBut Britain had a secret weapon too. They used something called the debt market to get money for their wars. They promised people that if they gave them money, they would get it back with extra money if Britain won the war. This helped them have more money for their army than other countries did. Because of all these things, Britain became very powerful and was able to control many lands.","70":"Long ago, France and England were rivals. England was able to spend more money on its military because it used the debt markets to fund its wars. France, on the other hand, went bankrupt because it couldn't keep up with England's modern ways of raising money. \n\nMany years ago, people in Europe wanted to find a new route to India. They needed spices to preserve their meat, and they wanted luxury goods. The Ottoman Turks had taken over the old route, so they needed a new way. Venice and Genoa were too small to stand up to the Turks, so Spain and Portugal got help from North Europeans and Genoese. The Portuguese were the first to find the sea route to India, followed by the Dutch, English, Danes, and French. Vasco Da Gama was the one who discovered the new route in 1498.","71":"Long ago, in the 15th century, Europe was filled with a spirit of change and growth. The economy was booming, and people wanted luxury goods like spices to preserve their meat. But there was a problem - the Ottoman Turks had captured important trade routes, making it hard to reach India. The small cities of Venice and Genoa couldn't stand up to the Turks, so Spain and Portugal asked for help from the North Europeans and the Genoese. \n\nThe Portuguese were the first to find a sea route to India, led by a man named Vasco Da Gama. He discovered the route in 1498 and returned in 1502 to set up trading stations in Calicut, Cochin, and Cannanore. Other Portuguese leaders followed, like Francisco de Almeida and Alfonso de Albuquerque, who captured Goa and persecuted Muslims. Nino da Cunha even moved the capital to Goa and took over Diu and Bassein from Gujarat King Bahadur Shah. It was a time of adventure and discovery, but also of conflict and conquest.","72":"Long ago, a group of Dutch traders came to India. They formed a company called the United East India Company of the Netherlands. This company had the power to fight wars, make treaties, and build forts. They wanted to trade with the people of India and make a profit.","73":"Long ago, the Dutch formed a powerful company called the United East India Company. They had the power to make treaties, build forts, and even wage wars. They came to India in 1602 and started trading.\n\nThe English were also ambitious and formed their own company, the English East India Company, in 1600. They had a monopoly to trade in the East Indies for 15 years. They defeated the Portuguese and established their first factory at Surat in 1613. They also secured permission to establish factories at Agra, Ahmedabad, and Broach. They even leased Bombay from Charles II for an annual rent of 10 pounds.","74":"Long ago, the English wanted to trade with the East Indies. Queen Elizabeth I gave them permission to do so for 15 years. They won battles against the Portuguese and established factories in Surat, Agra, Ahmedabad, and Broach. They also leased Bombay for 10 pounds. Later, they made Madras their headquarters and built Fort William in Calcutta. The Mughal Emperor Farrukhsiyar gave them special privileges. They merged with rival companies to become stronger.","75":"Long ago, a powerful Company came to rule over India. They were very rich and had many soldiers to protect their interests. But they were not the only ones who wanted to trade in India. The French also came and started their own Company called Compagnie des Indes Orientales. They built a headquarters in a place called Pondicherry, which was given to them by a governor named Sher Khan Lodi. \n\nThe English and French did not get along and fought many wars in India, just like they did in Europe. They both wanted to protect and expand their businesses. These wars were called the Carnatic wars and there were three of them. The first one started in 1740 and ended in 1748 with a treaty called Aix-La Chapelle. The English and French continued to fight for many years, but eventually, the French lost their power in India. Pondicherry was finally incorporated into the Indian Union in 1954.","76":"In the land of India, there were two powerful companies, the English and the French. They both wanted to protect and expand their businesses, so they fought three wars called the Carnatic Wars. The first war ended with a treaty, but the second war made the French weaker. The third war was very important and had a big battle called Wandiwash. The English won and the French were only allowed to use their settlements for business, not for building forts."},"quiz_prompt":{"0":"Context:Modern History of India: A summaryUNIT 2 Advent of Europeans and Consolidation of British Power in India Chapters 3 to 5 CHAPTER 3 Advent of the Europeans in India Though we talk of ancient, medieval, and modern periods in history, history is a continuity.\n    In the above context, create a multiple choice quiz for the follwowing text.

However, there were some weaknesses in Dupleix also, which can be put in brief as follows: (i) Dupleix suffered from an over-sanguine temperament. He hoped too often for too long, thus losing the advantage in critical situations. (ii) The peers of Dupleix did not like his autocratic behaviour and on many occasions quarrelled with him on this matter. (iii) Dupleix was not a man of action: he planned a campaign, directed his lieutenants, but never led an army in the battlefield like Lawrence or Clive.

However, there were some weaknesses in Dupleix also, which can be put in brief as follows: (i) Dupleix suffered from an over-sanguine temperament. He hoped too often for too long, thus losing the advantage in critical situations. (ii) The peers of Dupleix did not like his autocratic behaviour and on many occasions quarrelled with him on this matter. (iii) Dupleix was not a man of action: he planned a campaign, directed his lieutenants, but never led an army in the battlefield like Lawrence or Clive.

At Pondicherry, he made a lot of money by private trade, which was then permitted to servants of the French company. In December 1726, he was suspended owing to drastic change in the constitution of the French company and some confusions arising out of that. In 1730, Dupleix won his case, and was appointed as governor of Chandernagore as compensation. In 1741, he was appointed as the Director-General of French colonies in India. Later, he was conferred the title of Nawab by the Mughal emperor and the subahdar of Deccan, Muzzaffar Jang. . \n    In the context given above,Create a very short engaging newspaper article title for the following chunk : Later, he was conferred the title of Nawab by the Mughal emperor and the subahdar of Deccan, Muzzaffar Jang.

However, he decided to disobey the directors on the matter of fortification of settlements. He enhanced the defences of Pondicherry, even spending a large sum from his personal wealth. He made Pondicherry the emporium of commerce in south India by taking practical steps to develop the trade of the colony.

due to Dupleix\u2019s political decisions. <\/li>\n<li> The recall of Dupleix by the directors was a result of a compromise between France and England over issues in America. <\/li>","55":"<li>Many

France retaliated by seizing Madras in 1746 with the help of the fleet from Mauritius, the Isle of France, under Admiral La Bourdonnais, the French governor of Mauritius. Thus began the first Carnatic War. Result The First Carnatic War ended in 1748 when the Treaty of Aix-La Chapelle was signed, bringing the Austrian War of Succession to a conclusion. Under the terms of this treaty, Madras was handed back to the English, and the French, in turn, got their territories in North America.

The English navy was superior to the French navy; it helped to cut off the vital sea link between the French possessions in India and France. The English held three important places, namely, Calcutta, Bombay, and Madras, whereas the French had only Pondicherry.The French subordinated their commercial interest to territorial ambition, which made the French company short of funds.In spite of their imperialistic motives, the British never neglected their commercial interests. So, they always had the funds and the consequent sound financial condition to help them significantly in the wars against their rivals.
