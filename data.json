    "0": "Long ago, in the land of India, there were many different periods of history. Some were ancient, some were medieval, and some were modern. But history is like a never-ending story, with one period flowing into the next. When the Europeans first arrived in India, it marked the beginning of the modern period. But to understand this, we must go back to a time before even the great Mughal Empire was established.",
    "1": "After the Roman Empire fell, the Arabs became powerful in Egypt and Persia. This made it harder for Europeans to trade with India and get things like spices and precious stones. Then, in 1453, the Ottoman Turks took over Constantinople and made it even harder to trade. So, Europeans started looking for a new way to reach India by sea.",
    "2": "When the Ottomans were gaining power, Constantinople fell in 1453. The Arabs controlled the trade routes to India, making it difficult for Europeans to get their hands on spices, silk, and precious stones. The Europeans wanted to find a direct sea route to India, so they could trade without intermediaries. They were inspired by the Renaissance and had made great progress in ship-building and navigation.",
    "3": "As Europe advanced in ship-building and navigation, they longed to explore the unknown corners of the East. The region's economic development was also booming with improved farming techniques and increased meat supply, leading to a demand for spices and luxury goods from the East.",
    "4": "As Europe grew richer, people wanted more fancy things from the East. Venice and Genoa were too small to explore or fight the Ottoman Turks. But the north Europeans helped Portugal and Spain with money and men, and the Genoese gave them ships and knowledge. Portugal was also leading the fight against Islam and exploring like the Genoese.",
    "5": "Prince Henry of Portugal, also known as the \u2018Navigator\u2019, really wanted to find a way to get to India by sea. He didn't like that the Muslims controlled all the routes to India. The Pope gave him permission to sail to India in 1454, so he could spread Christianity and fight against the Muslims.",
    "6": "Prince Henry of Portugal, also known as the Navigator, wanted to find a way to reach India without going through Muslim-controlled areas. Pope Nicholas V gave him permission to sail to India and spread Christianity. Sadly, Prince Henry died before he could achieve his goal. Later, Portugal and Spain divided the non-Christian world between them, with Portugal claiming everything to the east of an imaginary line in the Atlantic. This allowed Portugal to explore the waters around India.",
    "7": "After Prince Henry's death, Portugal and Spain divided the non-Christian world between them. Portugal could claim everything to the east of an imaginary line in the Atlantic, while Spain could claim everything to the west. This allowed the Portuguese to explore the waters around India. In 1487, Bartholomew Dias sailed around the Cape of Good Hope and believed he had found the sea route to India. Ten years later, Portuguese ships set out for India and arrived in May 1498 after almost 11 months.",
    "8": "After Bartholomew Dias found a sea route to India, Portuguese ships set out for India in 1497. They arrived in May 1498, led by Vasco Da Gama and a Gujarati pilot named Abdul Majid. The Hindu ruler of Calicut welcomed them, but Arab traders were worried about the Portuguese taking over their business on the Malabar Coast.",
    "9": "The Arab traders were worried about the Portuguese coming to the Malabar Coast. They had been trading there for a long time with others from different places. Everyone followed certain rules, but the Portuguese wanted to be in charge and make all the money. Vasco da Gama stayed in India for three months."
