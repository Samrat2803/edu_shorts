For the Portuguese, the opening of a new sea-route to India would give a big blow to the Muslims, the Arabs, and the Turks, who were the traditional enemies of Christianity, and were posing a new threat to Europe by virtue of the growing military and naval power of the Turks. A direct sea-link with India would displace the virtual monopoly of the Arabs and Turks over the trade in eastern goods, especially spices. They also vaguely hoped by their exploration of Africa they would be able to link up with the kingdom of the legendary Prester John, (also called Presbyter John or John the Elder, believed to have been a Christian ruler of the East and popularised as such in medieval chronicales of the West) and be in a position to attack the Muslims from two sides.

    "0": "History is like a never-ending story. We talk about different periods like ancient, medieval, and modern, but they all connect to each other. When we talk about modern India, we start with the arrival of Europeans. This happened a long time ago, even before the Mughals came to power. The Portuguese were the first Europeans to come to India. They were looking for a new way to reach India by sea, after the Roman Empire fell. The Arabs were in control of Egypt and Persia at that time.",
    "1": "Long ago, when the Europeans first came to India, they were amazed by the wonderful spices, silk, and precious stones that they found there. But as time passed, it became harder and harder to get these treasures. The Arabs had taken control of the trade routes, and the Europeans had to rely on them to get what they wanted. But then, something amazing happened. The Europeans started building better ships and learning more about navigation. They were determined to find a new way to reach India, and they did! They discovered a sea route that would take them straight to the treasures they sought.",
    "2": "In those days, people in Europe were very curious about the faraway lands in the East. They wanted to explore and find new things. They also needed spices for cooking and preserving meat, which were very important for their growing economy. But it was hard to get these things because the Ottomans controlled the trade routes. So, the Europeans decided to find a new way to get to the East by sailing across the sea. Portugal and Spain got help from other countries like Genoa and even the north Europeans to make this happen.",
    "3": "Portugal wanted to find a new way to reach India and spread Christianity. Prince Henry, who was called the Navigator, was very interested in exploring. He wanted to avoid the Muslim-controlled routes to India. The Pope gave him permission to sail to the Orient and India. Sadly, Prince Henry died before he could make his dream come true.",
    "4": "Unfortunately, Prince Henry didn't live to see his dream come true. But in 1497, Portugal and Spain made a treaty to divide the non-Christian world between them. Portugal got everything to the east of an imaginary line in the Atlantic, while Spain got everything to the west. This set the stage for Portugal to explore India. In 1487, a Portuguese navigator named Bartholomew Dias sailed around the Cape of Good Hope in Africa and up the eastern coast. He believed he had found the sea route to India. Ten years later, a group of Portuguese ships set sail for India and arrived there in May 1498, after almost 11 months at sea.",
    "5": "After Prince Henry's death, Portugal and Spain divided the world between them. Portugal could claim everything to the east of an imaginary line in the Atlantic, while Spain could claim everything to the west. Bartholomew Dias found a sea route to India in 1487, and ten years later, Vasco Da Gama arrived in India with three ships. The Hindu ruler of Calicut welcomed him, but Arab traders were worried about the Portuguese taking over their business on the Malabar Coast.",
    "6": "The Portuguese came to India and wanted to control all the trade. Vasco da Gama stayed for three months and then went back to Portugal with lots of valuable things. He sold them for a lot of money. The Europeans realized that if they could trade directly with India, they could make a lot of money too.",
    "7": "After Vasco da Gama's successful trip to India, other European merchants wanted to trade directly too. Pedro Alvarez Cabral went on a voyage to India to trade for spices. He negotiated and set up a factory in Calicut, but there was a conflict with the locals. Cabral retaliated by seizing Arab merchant ships and bombarding Calicut. He later made treaties with rulers in Cochin and Cannanore. Vasco da Gama returned to India in 1501.",
    "8": "When Vasco da Gama returned to India, he wanted the Arab merchants to be excluded in favor of the Portuguese. But the Zamorin refused, and Vasco da Gama became very angry. He attacked Arab ships and caused a lot of damage. This made the Zamorin very upset with him.",
    "9": "The Portuguese wanted to find a new sea-route to India to hurt their enemies, the Muslims, Arabs, and Turks. They hoped to take over the trade in eastern goods, like spices, from the Arabs and Turks. They also wanted to explore Africa to find the kingdom of Prester John, a Christian ruler of the East. They thought this would help them attack the Muslims from two sides."

His rupture with the Zamorin\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b Advent of the Europeans in India 25 View The landing of Vasco da Gama at Calicut in 1498 ... is generally regarded as the beginning of a new era in world history, especially in the relationship between Asia and Europe. Although Asia and Europe had been in commercial relations with each other since antiquity, the opening of the direct sea-relations between the two was not only the fulfilment of an old dream (according to the Greek historian, Herodotus, the Phoenicians had rounded Africa in the 6th century BC), it presaged big increase of trade between the two. This, however, was only one of the objectives of the Portuguese. . \n    In the context given above, Extract the important dates out of the following chunk. Give the information in bullet points starting and ending with tag <li>. Chunk: This, however, was only one of the objectives of the Portuguese. For the Portuguese, the opening of a new sea-route to India would give a big blow to the Muslims, the Arabs, and the Turks, who were the traditional enemies of Christianity, and were posing a new threat to Europe by virtue of the growing military and naval power of the Turks. A direct sea-link with India would displace the virtual monopoly of the Arabs and Turks over the trade in eastern goods, especially spices. They also vaguely hoped by their exploration of Africa they would be able to link up with the kingdom of the legendary Prester John, (also called Presbyter John or John the Elder, believed to have been a Christian ruler of the East and popularised as such in medieval chronicales of the West) and be in a position to attack the Muslims from two sides.
