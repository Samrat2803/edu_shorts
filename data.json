So, if we think of the history of modern India as beginning with the advent of the Europeans, we need to go back to what is generally considered the medieval period, i.e., the 15th century itself\u2014indeed to a time even before the Mughals came and established their empire. 21\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 22 A Brief History of Modern India The Portuguese in India The Quest for and Discovery of a Sea Route to India After the decline of the Roman Empire in the 7th century, the Arabs had established their domination in Egypt and Persia. Direct contact between the Europeans and India declined, and, with that, the easy accessibility to the Indian commodities like spices, calicoes, silk, and various precious stones that were greatly in demand was affected. In 1453, Constantinople fell to the Ottoman Turks, who were on the ascendant. ",
    "1": "In 1453, Constantinople fell to the Ottoman Turks, who were on the ascendant. Merchandise from India went to the European markets through Arab Muslim intermediaries. The Red Sea trade route was a state monopoly from which Islamic rulers earned tremendous revenues. The land routes to India were also controlled by the Arabs. In the circumstances, the Europeans were keen to find a direct sea route to India. Fifteenth-century Europe was gripped by the spirit of the Renaissance with its call for exploration. At the same time, Europe made great advances in the art of ship-building and navigation. Hence, there was an eagerness all over Europe for adventurous sea voyages to reach the unknown corners of the East.The economic development of many regions of Europe was also progressing rapidly with expansion of land under cultivation, the introduction of an improved plough, scientific crop management such as crop rotation, and increased supply of meat (which called for spices for cooking as well as for preservation). Prosperity also grew, and with it the demand for oriental luxury goods also increased. ",
    "2": "Prosperity also grew, and with it the demand for oriental luxury goods also increased. Venice and Genoa which had earlier prospered through trade in oriental goods were too small to take on the mighty Ottoman Turks or to take up major exploration on their own. The north Europeans were ready to aid Portugal and Spain with money and men, even as the Genoese were ready to provide ships and technical knowledge. It is also to be noted that Portugal had assumed the leadership in Christendom\u2019s\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b Advent of the Europeans in India 23 resistance to Islam even as it had taken on itself the spirit of exploration that had characterised the Genoese. Historians have observed that the idea of finding an ocean route to India had become an obsession for Prince Henry of Portugal, who was nicknamed the \u2018Navigator\u2019; also, he was keen to find a way to circumvent the Muslim domination of the eastern Mediterranean and all the routes that connected India to Europe. ",
    "3": "Pope Nicholas V gave Prince Henry a bull in 1454, conferring on him the right to navigate the \u201csea to the distant shores of the Orient\u201d, more specifically \u201cas far as India\u201d in an attempt to fight Islamic influence and spread the Christian faith. However, Prince Henry died before his dream could become a reality. In 1497, under the Treaty of Tordesillas (1494), the rulers of Portugal and Spain divided the non-Christian world between them by an imaginary line in the Atlantic, some 1,300 miles west of the Cape Verde Islands. Under the treaty, Portugal could claim and occupy everything to the east of the line while Spain could claim everything to the west. The situation was thus prepared for the Portuguese incursions into the waters around India. It was in 1487 that the Portuguese navigator, Bartholomew Dias, rounded the Cape of Good Hope in Africa and sailed up the eastern coast; he was well convinced that the long-sought-after sea route to India had been found. But it was only ten years later that an expedition of Portuguese ships set out for India (in 1497) and arrived in India in slightly less than 11 months\u2019 time, in May 1498. ",
    "4": "From Trading to Ruling Vasco Da Gama The arrival of three ships under Vasco Da Gama, led by a Gujarati pilot named Abdul Majid, at Calicut in May 1498 profoundly affected the course of Indian history. The Hindu ruler of Calicut, the Zamorin (Samuthiri), however, had no apprehensions as to the European\u2019s intentions. As the prosperity of his kingdom was due to Calicut\u2019s position as an entrepot,\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 24 A Brief History of Modern India he accorded a friendly reception to Vasco Da Gama. The Arab traders, who had a good business on the Malabar Coast were apprehensive and were not keen on the Portuguese getting a hold there. For centuries, the trading system in the Indian Ocean had had numerous participants\u2014Indians, Arabs, Africans from the east coast, Chinese, Javanese, among others\u2014but these participants had acted according to some tacit rules of conduct and none had sought overwhelming dominance though all were in it for profit. ",
    "5": "The Portuguese changed that: they wanted to monopolise the hugely profitable eastern trade by excluding competitors, especially the Arabs. Vasco da Gama stayed in India for three months. When he returned to Portugal, he carried back with him a rich cargo and sold the merchandise in the European market at a huge profit. The importance of direct access to the pepper trade was made clear by the fact that elsewhere the Europeans, who had to buy through Muslim middlemen, would have had to spend ten times as much for the same amount of pepper. Not surprisingly, other profit-seeking merchants of European nations were tempted to come to India and trade directly. A voyage was undertaken by Pedro Alvarez Cabral to trade for spices; he negotiated and established a factory at Calicut, where he arrived in September 1500. There was an incident of conflict when the Portuguese factory at Calicut was attacked by the locals, resulting in the death of several Portuguese. ",
    "6": "In retaliation, Cabral seized a number of Arab merchant ships anchored in the harbour, and killed hundreds of their crew besides confiscating their cargo and burning the ships. Calicut was bombarded by Cabral. Later, Cabral succeeded in making advantageous treaties with the local rulers of Cochin and Cannanore. Vasco da Gama once again came to India in 1501. The Zamorin declined to exclude the Arab merchants in favour of the Portuguese when Vasco Da Gama combined commercial greed with ferocious hostility and wreaked vengeance on Arab shipping wherever he could. His rupture with the Zamorin\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b Advent of the Europeans in India 25 View The landing of Vasco da Gama at Calicut in 1498 ... is generally regarded as the beginning of a new era in world history, especially in the relationship between Asia and Europe. ",
    "7": "This, however, was only one of the objectives of the Portuguese. For the Portuguese, the opening of a new sea-route to India would give a big blow to the Muslims, the Arabs, and the Turks, who were the traditional enemies of Christianity, and were posing a new threat to Europe by virtue of the growing military and naval power of the Turks. A direct sea-link with India would displace the virtual monopoly of the Arabs and Turks over the trade in eastern goods, especially spices. They also vaguely hoped by their exploration of Africa they would be able to link up with the kingdom of the legendary Prester John, (also called Presbyter John or John the Elder, believed to have been a Christian ruler of the East and popularised as such in medieval chronicales of the West) and be in a position to attack the Muslims from two sides. ",
    "8": "Thus, the commercial and religious objectives supported and justified each other.\u2014Satish Chandra thus became total and complete. Vasco da Gama set up a trading factory at Cannanore. Gradually, Calicut, Cannanore, and Cochin became the important trade centres of the Portuguese.Gradually, under the pretext of protecting the factories and their trading activities, the Portuguese got permission to fortify these centres. Francisco De Almeida In 1505, the King of Portugal appointed a governor in India for a three-year term and equipped the incumbent with sufficient force to protect the Portuguese interests. Francisco De Almeida, the newly appointed governor, was asked to consolidate the position of the Portuguese in India and to destroy Muslim trade by seizing Aden, Ormuz, and Malacca. He was also advised to build fortresses at Anjadiva, Cochin,\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 26 A Brief History of Modern India View As long as you may be powerful at sea you will hold India as yours; and if you do not possess this power, little will avail you a fortress on shore. \u2014Francisco De Almeida Cannanore, and Kilwa. ",
    "9": "\u2014Francisco De Almeida Cannanore, and Kilwa. What Almeida, however, encountered along with the opposition of the Zamorin, was a threat from the Mameluke Sultan of Egypt. Encouraged by the merchants of Venice, whose lucrative commerce was now at risk due to the Portuguese interference, the Egyptians raised a fleet in the Red Sea to stop the advance of the Portuguese. In 1507, the Portuguese squadron was defeated in a naval battle off Diu by the combined Egyptian and Gujarat navies, and Almeida\u2019s son was killed. Next year, Almeida avenged his defeat by totally crushing the two navies. Almeida\u2019s vision was to make the Portuguese the master of the Indian Ocean. His policy was known as the Blue Water Policy (cartaze system). Alfonso de Albuquerque Albuquerque, who succeeded Almeida as the Portuguese governor in India, was the real founder of the Portuguese power in the East, a task he completed before his death. He secured for Portugal the strategic control of the Indian Ocean by establishing bases overlooking all the entrances to the sea. ",
    "10": "He secured for Portugal the strategic control of the Indian Ocean by establishing bases overlooking all the entrances to the sea. There were Portuguese strongholds in East Africa, off the Red Sea, at Ormuz; in Malabar; and at Malacca. The Portuguese, under Albuquerque bolstered their stranglehold by introducing a permit system for other ships and exercising control over the major ship-building centres in the region. The non- availability of timber in the Gulf and Red Sea regions for ship-building also helped the Portuguese in their objectives. Albuquerque acquired Goa from the Sultan of Bijapur in 1510 with ease; the principal port of the Sultan of Bijapur became \u201cthe first bit of Indian territory to be under the Europeans since the time of Alexander the Great\u201d. An interesting feature of his rule was the abolition of sati.\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b Advent of the Europeans in India 27 View Bitter persecution of Muslims was one serious drawback of Albuquerque\u2019s policy. This could have been due to his resolve to further the interests of his countrymen by complete extinction of Muslim commercial interests in the East. ",
    "11": "This could have been due to his resolve to further the interests of his countrymen by complete extinction of Muslim commercial interests in the East. During his rule, Albuquerque did his best to strengthen the fortifications of Goa and enhance its commercial importance. In order to secure a permanent Portuguese population in India he encouraged his men to take Indian wives. The Gazetteer of India, Vol. II The Portuguese men who had come on the voyages and stayed back in India were, from Albuquerque\u2019s day, encouraged to take local wives. In Goa and the Province of the North, they established themselves as village landlords, often building new roads and irrigation works, introducing new crops like tobacco and cashew nut, or better plantation varieties of coconut besides planting large groves of coconut to meet the need for coir rigging and cordage. In the cities, they settled as artisans and master-craftsmen, besides being traders. Most of such Portuguese came to look upon their new settlements, rather than Portugal, as home. ",
    "12": "Nino da Cunha Nino da Cunha assumed office of the governor of Portuguese interests in India in November 1529 and almost one year later shifted the headquarters of the Portuguese government in India from Cochin to Goa. Bahadur Shah of Gujarat, during his conflict with the Mughal emperor Humayun, secured help from the Portuguese by ceding to them in 1534 the island of Bassein with its dependencies and revenues. He also promised them a base in Diu. However, Bahadur Shah\u2019s relations with the Portuguese became sour when Humayun withdrew from Gujarat in 1536. Since the inhabitants of the town started fighting with the Portuguese, Bahadur Shah wanted to raise a wall of partition. Opposing this, the Portuguese started negotiations, in the course of which the ruler of Gujarat was invited to a Portuguese ship and killed in 1537. ",
    "13": "In the Deccan, the Bahmani Kingdom was breaking up into smaller kingdoms. None of the powers had a navy worth its name, nor did they think of developing their naval strength. In the Far East, the imperial decree of the Chinese emperor limited the navigational reach of the Chinese ships. As regards the Arab merchants and ship-owners who until then dominated the Indian Ocean trade, they had nothing to match the organisation and unity of the Portuguese. Moreover, the Portuguese had cannons placed on their ships. Portuguese State The general tendency is to underestimate the Portuguese hold in India. However, the Estado Portugu\u00eas da India (State of the Portuguese India) was in fact a larger element in Indian history than it is given credit for. Many of the coastal parts of India had come under Portuguese power within fifty years of Vasco da Gama\u2019s arrival. The Portuguese had occupied some sixty miles of coast around Goa. ",

On the west coast from Mumbai to Daman and Diu to the approaches to Gujarat, they controlled a narrow tract with four important ports and hundreds of towns and villages. In the south, they had under them a chain of seaport fortresses and trading-posts like Mangalore, Cannanore, Cochin, and Calicut. And though their power in Malabar was not consolidated, it was enough to ensure influence or control over the local rulers who held the spice-growing land. The Portuguese established further military posts and settlements on the east coast at San Thome (in Chennai) and Nagapattinam (in Tamil Nadu). Towards the end of the 16th century, a wealthy settlement had grown at Hooghly in West Bengal. Envoys and ambassadors were exchanged between Goa and many of the major kingdoms in India of the time. Treaties were signed between Goa and the Deccan sultans in 1570, which were regularly renewed as long as their kingdoms\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b Advent of the Europeans in India 29 lasted. ",
    "15": "The Portuguese always had a role to play in the successive battles for the balance of power between Vijayanagara and the Deccan sultans, between the Deccanis and the Mughals, and between the Mughals and the Marathas. Interestingly, the Portuguese, the first Europeans to come to India, were also the last to leave this land. It was 1961 before the Government of India recaptured Goa, Daman and Diu from them. Portuguese Administration in India The head of the administration was the viceroy who served for three years, with his secretary and, in later years, a council. Next in importance came the Vedor da Fazenda, responsible for revenues and the cargoes and dispatch of fleets. The fortresses, from Africa to China, were under captains, assisted by \u2018factors\u2019, whose power was increased by the difficulties of communication and was too often used for personal ends. Religious Policy of the Portuguese The Moors were the bitter enemies of the Portuguese in North Africa. So were the Arabs. ",
    "16": "Religious Policy of the Portuguese The Moors were the bitter enemies of the Portuguese in North Africa. So were the Arabs. Arriving in the East, the Portuguese brought with them the same zeal to promote Christianity and the wish to persecute all Muslims. Intolerant towards the Muslims, the Portuguese were initially quite tolerant towards the Hindus. However, over time, after the introduction of the Inquisition in Goa, there was a change and Hindus were also persecuted. But, in spite of this intolerant behaviour, the Jesuits made a good impression at the court of Akbar, mainly due to the Mughal emperor\u2019s interest in questions of theology. In September 1579, Akbar forwarded a letter to the authorities at Goa, requesting them to send two learned priests. The Church authorities in Goa eagerly accepted the invitation, seeing in it a chance to convert the emperor to Christianity, and with him his court and the people. Jesuit fathers, Rodolfo Aquaviva and Antonio Monserrate, were selected for the purpose. ",

The second mission called by Akbar in 1590 also ended on a similar note in 1592. The third mission, again invited by Akbar, arrived in 1595 at Lahore (where the court was then residing) and continued as a sort of permanent institution, thereby extending its influence on secular politics. Fathers Jerome Xavier and Emanuel Pinheiro were the leaders of the mission, and their letters from the court became very widely known for the information they provided on the later part of Akbar\u2019s reign. Prince Salim, on ascending the throne as Jahangir, assuaged the Muslims by neglecting the Jesuit fathers. Gradually, however, his temporary estrangement from the Jesuits ended, and in 1606, he renewed his favours to them. The elegant and spacious church at Lahore was allowed to be retained by them along with the collegium or the priests\u2019 residence. ",

In 1608, a number of baptisms were carried out in Agra, the priests publicly acting with as much liberty as in Portugal. Jahangir\u2019s conduct was such that the Jesuit priests became hopeful of bringing him within the Christian fold. However, these hopes were belied. Moreover, arrogant actions on the part of the Portuguese viceroys created a rift with the Mughal emperor. Portuguese Lose Favour with the Mughals In 1608, Captain William Hawkins with his ship Hector reached Surat. He brought with him a letter from James I, King of England, to the Mughal court of Jahangir, requesting permission to do business in India. Father Pinheiro and the Portuguese authorities did their best to prevent Hawkins from reaching the Mughal court, but they did not succeed. Jahangir accepted the gifts Hawkins brought for him and gave Hawkins a very favourable reception in 1609. As Hawkins knew the Turki language well, he conversed with the emperor in that language without the aid of an interpreter. ",

Hawkins was also married to the daughter of an Armenian Christian named Mubarak Shah (Mubarikesha). The grant of trading facilities to the English offended the Portuguese. However, after negotiations, a truce was established between the Portuguese and the Mughal emperor. The Portuguese stopped the English ships from entering the port of Surat. A baffled Hawkins left the Mughal court in 1611, unable to counter the Portuguese intrigues or check the vacillating Mughal policies. However, in November 1612, the English ship Dragon under Captain Best along with a little ship, the Osiander, successfully fought a Portuguese fleet. Jahangir, who had no navy worth its name, learnt of the English success and was greatly impressed. The Portuguese acts of piracy also resulted in conflict with the imperial Mughal government. ",
    "20": "The Portuguese acts of piracy also resulted in conflict with the imperial Mughal government. In 1613, the Portuguese offended Jahangir by capturing Mughal ships, imprisoning many Muslims, and plundering the cargoes. An enraged Jahangir ordered Muqarrab Khan, who was then in charge of Surat, to obtain compensation. However, it was during the reign of Shah Jahan, that the advantages which the Portuguese enjoyed in the Mughal court were lost forever. Also lost were the hopes of converting the royal family and Mughal India to Christianity, a hope that the Portuguese held because of the welcome accorded to them and their religion by Akbar and Jahangir. Capture of Hooghly On the basis of an imperial farman circa 1579, the Portuguese had settled down on a river bank which was a short distance from Satgaon in Bengal to carry on their trading activities. Over the years, they strengthened their position by constructing big buildings which led to the migration of the trade from Satgaon to the new port known as Hooghly. ",
    "21": "They monopolised the manufacture of salt, built a custom house of their own, and started enforcing strictly the levy of duty on tobacco, which had become an important article of trade since its introduction at the beginning of the 17th century.\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 32 A Brief History of Modern India The Portuguese not only made money as traders but also started a cruel slave trade by purchasing or seizing Hindu and Muslim children, whom they brought up as Christians. In the course of their nefarious activities, they seized two slave girls of Mumtaz Mahal. On June 24, 1632, the Mughal siege of Hooghly began, ending in its capture three months later. Shah Jahan ordered the Bengal governor Qasim Khan to take action against the Portuguese. The siege of Hooghly finally led to the Portuguese fleeing. The Mughals suffered a loss of 1,000 men, but also took 400 prisoners to Agra. The prisoners were offered the option to convert to Islam or become slaves. The persecution of Christians continued for some time after which it died down gradually. ",
    "22": "Decline of the Portuguese By the 18th century, the Portuguese in India lost their commercial influence, though some of them still carried on trade in their individual capacity and many took to piracy and robbery. In fact, Hooghly was used by some Portuguese as a base for piracy in the Bay of Bengal. The decline of the Portuguese was brought about by several factors. The local advantages gained by the Portuguese in India were reduced with the emergence of powerful dynasties in Egypt, Persia, and North India and the rise of the turbulent Marathas as their immediate neighbours. (The Marathas captured Salsette and Bassein in 1739 from the Portuguese.) The religious policies of the Portuguese, such as the activities of the Jesuits, gave rise to political fears. Their antagonism for the Muslims apart, the Portuguese policy of conversion to Christianity made Hindus also resentful. Their dishonest trade practices also evoked a strong reaction. The Portuguese earned notoriety as sea pirates. ",

The earlier monopoly of knowledge of the sea route to India held by the Portuguese could not remain a secret forever; soon enough the Dutch and the English, who were learning the skills of ocean navigation, also learnt of it.

    "24": "As new trading communities from Europe arrived in India, there began a fierce rivalry among them. In this struggle, the Portuguese had to give way to the more powerful and enterprising competitors. The Dutch and the English had greater resources and more compulsions to expand overseas, and they overcame the Portuguese resistance. ",
    "25": "Goa which remained with the Portuguese had lost its importance as a port after the fall of the Vijayanagara empire and soon it did not matter in whose possession it was. The spice trade came under the control of the Dutch, and Goa was superseded by Brazil as the economic centre of the overseas empire of Portugal. In 1683, after two naval assaults, the Marathas invaded Goa. Significance of the Portuguese Most historians have observed that the coming of the Portuguese not only initiated what might be called the European era, it marked the emergence of naval power. The Cholas, among others, had been a naval power, but it was now for the first time a foreign power had come to India by way of the sea. The Portuguese ships carried cannon, and this was the first step in gaining monopoly over trade\u2014with the threat or actual use of force. ",
    "26": "The Portuguese ships carried cannon, and this was the first step in gaining monopoly over trade\u2014with the threat or actual use of force. The Portuguese declared their intention to abide by no rules except their own, and they were intent on getting a decisive advantage over the Indians and over the Indian Ocean trading system. In the Malabar of the 16th century, the Portuguese showed military innovation in their use of body armour, matchlock men, and guns landed from the ships. The Portuguese may have contributed by example to the Mughal use of field guns, and the \u2018artillery of the stirrup\u2019. However, an important military contribution made by the Portuguese onshore was the system of drilling groups of infantry, on the Spanish model, introduced in the 1630s as a counter to Dutch pressure. The practice was adopted first by the French and English, and later taken up by the Marathas and Sikhs, and such armies of sepoys became new tools of empire in India. The Portuguese were masters of improved techniques at sea. ",
    "27": "Their multi-decked ships were heavily constructed, designed as they were to ride out Atlantic gales rather than run before the regular monsoons; this permitted them to carry a heavier armament.

However, the Portuguese skill at organisation\u2014as in the creation of royal arsenals and dockyards and the maintenance of a regular system of pilots and mapping and pitting state forces against private merchant shipping\u2014was even more noteworthy. The Mughals and Marathas may certainly have learnt from the Portuguese, but the more certain heirs of this knowledge were other Europeans, especially the Dutch and English, in Asia. In India, the memory of religious persecution and cruelty detracts from the other contributions made by the Portuguese in the cultural field. However, it cannot be forgotten that the missionaries and the Church were also teachers and patrons in India of the arts of the painter, carver, and sculptor. ",
    "28": "However, it cannot be forgotten that the missionaries and the Church were also teachers and patrons in India of the arts of the painter, carver, and sculptor. As in music, they were the interpreters, not just of Portuguese, but of European art to India. The art of the silversmith and goldsmith flourished in Goa, and the place became a centre of elaborate filigree work, fretted foliage, work, and metal work embedding jewels. However, though the interior of churches built under the Portuguese have plenty of woodwork and sculpture and sometimes painted ceilings, they are generally simple in their architectural plan. The Dutch Commercial enterprise led the Dutch to undertake voyages to the East. Cornelis de Houtman was the first Dutchman to reach Sumatra and Bantam in 1596. In 1602, the States- General of the Netherlands amalgamated many trading companies into the East India Company of the Netherlands. This company was also empowered to carry on war, to conclude treaties, to take possession of territory, and to erect fortresses.

Participating in the redistributive or carrying trade, they took to the islands of the Far East various articles and merchandise from India. They carried indigo manufactured in the Yamuna valley and Central India, textiles and silk from Bengal, Gujarat and the Coromandel, saltpetre from Bihar, and opium and rice from the Ganga valley. ",
    "30": "Anglo-Dutch Rivalry The English were also at this time rising to prominence in the Eastern trade, and this posed a serious challenge to the commercial interests of the Dutch. Commercial rivalry soon turned into bloody warfare. The climax of the enmity between the Dutch and the English in the East was reached at Amboyna (a place in present-day Indonesia, which the Dutch had captured from the Portuguese in 1605) where they massacred ten Englishmen and nine Japanese in 1623. This incident further intensified the rivalry between the two European companies. After prolonged warfare, both the parties came to a compromise in 1667 by which the British agreed to withdraw all their claims on Indonesia, and the Dutch retired from India to concentrate on their more profitable trade in Indonesia. They monopolised the trade in black pepper and spices. The most important Indian commodities the Dutch traded in were silk, cotton, indigo, rice, and opium.

    "32": "The retaliation by the English resulted in the defeat of the Dutch, in the Battle of Hooghly (November 1759), which dealt a crushing blow to Dutch ambitions in India. The Dutch were not much interested in empire building in India; their concerns were trade. In any case, their main commercial interest lay in the Spice Islands of Indonesia from where they earned a huge profit through business. The English Charter of Queen Elizabeth I Francis Drake\u2019s voyage around the world in 1580 and the English victory over the Spanish Armada in 1588 generated a new sense of enterprise in the British, encouraging sailors to venture out to the East. As the knowledge grew of the high profits earned by the Portuguese in Eastern trade, English traders too wanted a share. So, in 1599, a group of English merchants calling themselves the \u2018Merchant Adventurers\u2019 formed a company. On December 31, 1600, Queen Elizabeth I issued a charter with rights of exclusive trading to the company named the \u2018Governor and Company of Merchants of London trading into the East Indies\u2019. ",
    "33": "Initially, a monopoly of 15 years was granted, which in May\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 38 A Brief History of Modern India 1609 was extended indefinitely by a fresh charter. As the Dutch were already concentrating more on the East Indies, the English turned to India in search of textiles and other commodities of trade. Progress of the English Company Foothold in West and South Captain Hawkins arrived in the court of Jahangir in April 1609 itself. But the mission to establish a factory at Surat did not succeed due to opposition from the Portuguese, and Hawkins left Agra in November 1611. In 1611, the English had started trading at Masulipatnam on the south-eastern coast of India and later established a factory there in 1616. It was in 1612 that Captain Thomas Best defeated the Portuguese in the sea off Surat; an impressed Jahangir granted permission to the English in early 1613 to establish a factory at Surat under Thomas Aldworth. ",
    "34": "In 1615, Sir Thomas Roe came as an accredited ambassador of James I to the court of Jahangir, staying on there till February 1619. Though he was unsuccessful in concluding a commercial treaty with the Mughal emperor, he was able to secure a number of privileges, including permission to set up factories at Agra, Ahmedabad, and Broach. The English company did not have a smooth progress. It had to contend with the Portuguese and the Dutch in the beginning. But the changing situation helped them and turned things in their favour. Bombay had been gifted to King Charles II by the King of Portugal as dowry when Charles married the Portuguese princess Catherine in 1662. Bombay was given over to the East India Company on an annual payment of 10 pounds only in 1668. Later, Bombay was made the headquarters by shifting the seat of the Western Presidency from Surat to Bombay in 1687. So, there was tacit peace between the English and the Portuguese now. ",
    "35": "There was also an Anglo-Dutch compromise as mentioned earlier by which the Dutch agreed not to interfere with the English company\u2019s trade in India. Thus, the English were rid of two arch-rivals in India.\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b Advent of the Europeans in India 39 The English company\u2019s position was improved by the \u2018Golden Farman\u2019 issued to them by the Sultan of Golconda in 1632. On a payment of 500 pagodas a year, they earned the privilege of trading freely in the ports of Golconda. A member of the Masulipatnam council, the British merchant Francis Day in 1639 received from the ruler of Chandragiri permission to build a fortified factory at Madras which later became the Fort St. George and replaced Masulipatnam as the headquarters of the English settlements in south India. Thereafter, the English extended their trading activities to the east and started factories at Hariharpur in the Mahanadi delta and at Balasore (in Odisha) in 1633. Foothold in Bengal Bengal was then a large and rich province in India, advanced in trade and commerce. ",
    "36": "Commercial and political control over Bengal naturally appeared an attractive proposition to the profit-seeking English merchants. Bengal was also an important province of the Mughal empire. Shah Shuja, the subahdar (or governor) of Bengal in 1651, allowed the English to trade in Bengal in return for an annual payment of Rs 3,000, in lieu of all duties. Factories in Bengal were started at Hooghly (1651) and other places like Kasimbazar, Patna, and Rajmahal. Nevertheless, despite the privileges of the farmans, the Company\u2019s business was now and then obstructed by customs officers in the local checkposts who asked for payment of tolls. In pursuance of its changed policy, the Company wanted to have a fortified settlement at Hooghly so that force could be used if necessary. William Hedges, the first agent and governor of the Company in Bengal, appealed to Shaista Khan, the Mughal governor of Bengal in August 1682, for redressal of the grievance. As nothing came out of the appeal, hostilities broke out between the English and the Mughals. ",
    "37": "As nothing came out of the appeal, hostilities broke out between the English and the Mughals. Four years later, Hooghly was sacked by the imperial Mughals in October 1686. The English retaliated by capturing the imperial forts at Thana (modern Garden Reach), raiding Hijli in east Midnapur and storming the Mughal fortifications at\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 40 A Brief History of Modern India Balasore. However, the English were forced to leave Hooghly and were sent to an unhealthy location at the mouth of River Ganga.After the Mughal raid on Hooghly, Job Charnock, a company agent, started negotiations with the Mughals so as to return to a place called Sutanuti. Charnock signed a treaty with the Mughals in February 1690, and returned to Sutanuti in August 1690. Thus, an English factory was established on February 10, 1691, the day an imperial farman was issued, permitting the English to \u201ccontinue contentedly their trade in Bengal\u201d on payment of Rs 3,000 a year in lieu of all dues. A zamindar in Bardhaman district, Sobha Singh, rebelled, subsequently giving the English the pretext they were looking for, to fortify their settlement at Sutanuti in 1696. ",
    "38": "A zamindar in Bardhaman district, Sobha Singh, rebelled, subsequently giving the English the pretext they were looking for, to fortify their settlement at Sutanuti in 1696. In 1698, the English succeeded in getting the permission to buy the zamindari of the three villages of Sutanuti, Gobindapur, and Kalikata (Kalighat) from their owners on payment of Rs 1,200. The fortified settlement was named Fort William in the year 1700 when it also became the seat of the eastern presidency (Calcutta) with Sir Charles Eyre as its first president. Farrukhsiyar\u2019s Farmans In 1715, an English mission led by John Surman to the court of the Mughal emperor Farrukhsiyar secured three famous farmans, giving the Company many valuable privileges in Bengal, Gujarat and Hyderabad. The farmans thus obtained were regarded the Magna Carta of the Company. Their important terms were: \u25cf In Bengal, the Company\u2019s imports and exports were exempted from additional customs duties excepting the annual payment of 3,000 rupees as settled earlier. \u25cf The Company was permitted to issue dastaks (passes) for the transportation of such goods. \u25cf The Company was permitted to rent more lands around Calcutta.

The history of modern India began with the arrival of the Europeans in the 15th century, even before the Mughals established their empire. The decline of the Roman Empire in the 7th century led to a decline in direct contact between Europe and India, affecting the accessibility of Indian commodities like spices, calicoes, silk, and precious stones. Constantinople fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453, further impacting trade.",
    "1": "After the fall of Constantinople in 1453, Arab Muslim intermediaries controlled the trade routes to India. The Europeans, eager to find a direct sea route to India, made great advances in ship-building and navigation. They wanted to reach the unknown corners of the East and meet the demand for oriental luxury goods, which increased with the economic development of many regions of Europe.",
    "2": "As prosperity grew in Europe, so did the demand for luxury goods from the East. Venice and Genoa were too small to compete with the Ottoman Turks, but the north Europeans were ready to aid Portugal and Spain with money and men. Portugal took on the leadership in resisting Islam and exploring new routes to India, with Prince Henry of Portugal leading the way as an obsessed navigator.",

Pope Nicholas V gave him permission to navigate to India, but he died before it could happen. In 1497, Portugal and Spain divided the non-Christian world between them, with Portugal claiming everything to the east of an imaginary line in the Atlantic. Portuguese navigator Bartholomew Dias rounded the Cape of Good Hope in 1487, and ten years later, an expedition of Portuguese ships arrived in India in May 1498.",

    "5": "The Portuguese wanted to control the profitable eastern trade by excluding competitors, especially the Arabs. Vasco da Gama stayed in India for three months and returned to Portugal with a rich cargo, selling it at a huge profit. Other European merchants were tempted to come to India and trade directly.

When Vasco da Gama returned in 1501, he sought to exclude Arab merchants, but faced resistance from the Zamorin due to his hostility towards them. The landing of da Gama in 1498 marked a new era in world history.",
    "7": "The Portuguese wanted to weaken their enemies, the Muslims, Arabs, and Turks, by finding a new sea-route to India. They hoped to break the monopoly of the Arabs and Turks over the trade in eastern goods and explore Africa to find the legendary Prester John, who they believed would help them attack the Muslims from two sides.",
    "8": "The Portuguese had multiple objectives in opening a sea-route to India. They wanted to weaken the Muslims, Arabs, and Turks who were enemies of Christianity and posed a threat to Europe. They also aimed to break the monopoly of the Arabs and Turks over the trade in eastern goods and hoped to find Prester John's kingdom to attack the Muslims from two sides. The Portuguese set up trading factories at Cannanore, Calicut, and Cochin, and gradually got permission to fortify these centres. Francisco De Almeida was appointed as governor to consolidate their position and destroy Muslim trade by seizing Aden, Ormuz, and Malacca.",
    "9": "Francisco De Almeida was appointed as the governor of India by the King of Portugal in 1505. He was tasked with consolidating the Portuguese position in India and destroying Muslim trade. He was also advised to build fortresses at various trade centres. However, he faced opposition from the Zamorin and a threat from the Mameluke Sultan of Egypt. In 1507, the Portuguese squadron was defeated in a naval battle off Diu, but Almeida avenged his defeat the next year. Alfonso de Albuquerque succeeded Almeida and established bases overlooking all the entrances to the Indian Ocean, securing strategic control for Portugal.",
    "10": "Albuquerque established Portuguese bases in East Africa, off the Red Sea, at Ormuz, in Malabar, and at Malacca. He introduced a permit system for other ships and controlled major ship-building centers. Albuquerque acquired Goa from the Sultan of Bijapur in 1510 and abolished sati. However, his policy of persecuting Muslims was a drawback.",
    "11": "Albuquerque persecuted Muslims to eliminate their commercial interests in the East. He strengthened Goa's fortifications and encouraged Portuguese men to take Indian wives to establish a permanent population. They became landlords, introduced new crops, and settled as artisans and traders, considering their new settlements as home.",
    "12": "Nino da Cunha became governor of Portuguese interests in India in 1529 and moved the government headquarters to Goa a year later. Bahadur Shah of Gujarat gave the Portuguese the island of Bassein and promised them a base in Diu in 1534, but their relationship soured when Humayun withdrew from Gujarat in 1536. The Portuguese killed the ruler of Gujarat in 1537 after negotiations failed.",
    "13": "In the Deccan, kingdoms were forming as the Bahmani Kingdom broke up. None of them had strong navies. The Chinese emperor limited the reach of Chinese ships, and Arab merchants had no match for the Portuguese organization and unity. The Portuguese had cannons on their ships, making them a formidable force. The Estado Portugu\u00eas da India was a significant element in Indian history, occupying around sixty miles of coast around Goa.",
    "14": "Within fifty years of Vasco da Gama's arrival, the Portuguese had control over many coastal parts of India. They occupied around sixty miles of coast around Goa and controlled a narrow tract with four important ports and hundreds of towns and villages on the west coast. In the south, they had a chain of seaport fortresses and trading-posts like Mangalore, Cannanore, Cochin, and Calicut. They also established military posts and settlements on the east coast and in West Bengal, and signed treaties with the Deccan sultans.",
    "15": "The Portuguese played a role in battles for power in India. They were the first and last Europeans to come to India, leaving in 1961. The viceroy was the head of administration, with a council and Vedor da Fazenda. Fortresses were under captains and factors. The Portuguese had conflicts with Moors and Arabs.",
    "16": "The Portuguese wanted to promote Christianity and persecute Muslims in the East. They were initially tolerant towards Hindus, but later persecuted them too. However, the Jesuits made a good impression at the court of Akbar, who was interested in theology. Akbar invited two priests from Goa to convert him and his court to Christianity. Jesuit fathers, Rodolfo Aquaviva and Antonio Monserrate, were selected for the purpose.",
    "17": "The Jesuits were invited by Akbar to convert him and his court to Christianity. Aquaviva and Monserrate were selected for the purpose and were received with honour when they reached Fatehpur Sikri. However, their mission failed and the hopes of the Portuguese were belying. The third mission arrived in 1595 and became a sort of permanent institution, extending its influence on secular politics.",
    "18": "The Jesuits were allowed to keep the church and priests' residence in Lahore. In 1608, the priests baptized people in Agra and hoped to convert Jahangir to Christianity, but their hopes were dashed. The Portuguese viceroys' arrogance caused a rift with the Mughal emperor. Captain William Hawkins arrived in Surat with a letter from King James I, requesting permission to do business in India. Despite the Portuguese authorities' efforts to stop him, Hawkins met with Jahangir and conversed with him in Turki.",
    "19": "Hawkins spoke Turki with Jahangir and was appointed as a mansabdar of 400 with a salary of Rs 30,000. He married Mubarikesha, daughter of an Armenian Christian. The Portuguese were offended by the grant of trading facilities to the English, but a truce was established after negotiations. Hawkins left the Mughal court in 1611, unable to counter the Portuguese intrigues. In November 1612, the English ship Dragon successfully fought a Portuguese fleet, impressing Jahangir. The Portuguese acts of piracy resulted in conflict with the Mughal government.",
    "20": "The Portuguese piracy caused conflict with the Mughal government. In 1613, they captured Mughal ships, imprisoned Muslims, and plundered cargoes. Jahangir ordered compensation, but it was during Shah Jahan's reign that the Portuguese lost their advantages in the Mughal court. They also lost hope of converting the royal family to Christianity. \n\nThe Portuguese settled on a river bank near Satgaon in Bengal for trading. They built big buildings and the trade moved to the new port of Hooghly.",
    "21": "The Portuguese controlled salt production, built their own custom house, and enforced tobacco taxes strictly. They also engaged in a cruel slave trade, taking Hindu and Muslim children as slaves. In 1632, the Mughal siege of Hooghly began, leading to the capture of the city three months later. The Portuguese fled, and the Mughals took 400 prisoners who were given the choice to convert to Islam or become slaves. The persecution of Christians continued for some time before gradually dying down.",
    "22": "By the 18th century, the Portuguese lost their commercial influence in India. Some continued trade individually, while others turned to piracy and robbery. Hooghly was used as a base for piracy in the Bay of Bengal. The decline was due to the emergence of powerful dynasties in Egypt, Persia, and North India, the rise of the Marathas, and their religious policies, trade practices, and piracy.",
    "23": "The Portuguese became sea pirates and were disliked by rulers and the Mughals. Portugal's focus shifted to Brazil and they were dragged into Spain's wars. The Dutch and English learned the sea route to India, ending Portuguese trade monopoly.",
    "24": "With the arrival of new European traders in India, competition grew fierce. The Portuguese, with their limited resources, were unable to compete with the more powerful Dutch and English. These new competitors had greater resources and a stronger drive to expand overseas, ultimately overcoming Portuguese resistance.",
    "25": "Goa lost its importance as a port after the fall of the Vijayanagara empire. The Dutch controlled the spice trade and Brazil became the new economic center of Portugal's overseas empire. In 1683, the Marathas invaded Goa. The Portuguese marked the emergence of naval power in India and gained monopoly over trade with the use of force.",
    "26": "The Portuguese ships had cannons, which helped them gain a monopoly over trade through force. They did not follow any rules and wanted to dominate the Indian Ocean trading system. They also showed military innovation on land, such as using body armour and guns, and introduced drilling groups of infantry, which was later adopted by other armies in India. The Portuguese were skilled at sea and improved techniques in naval power.",
    "27": "The Portuguese ships were strong and had many decks, allowing them to carry heavy weapons. They used castles on the front and back to defend against boarding. They also had good organization, with royal arsenals and a system of pilots and mapping. The Portuguese taught the Mughals and Marathas, but the Dutch and English learned the most. The Portuguese also taught art in India.",
    "28": "The Portuguese missionaries and Church were also teachers and patrons of the arts in India, including painting, carving, and sculpture. They introduced European art to India and helped the art of silversmith and goldsmith flourish in Goa. However, the churches built by the Portuguese were generally simple in their architectural plan. The Dutch also arrived in India and founded their first factory in Masulipatnam in 1605, after forming the East India Company of the Netherlands in 1602.",
    "29": "After arriving in India, the Dutch established their first factory in Masulipatnam in 1605. They then set up trading centers in different parts of India, becoming a threat to the Portuguese. They captured Nagapatam and made it their main stronghold in South India. The Dutch also established factories in Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Bengal, and Bihar, and participated in the redistributive trade, carrying various articles and merchandise from India to the islands of the Far East.",
    "30": "The English challenged the Dutch in the Eastern trade, leading to warfare. The rivalry peaked at Amboyna, where the Dutch massacred ten Englishmen and nine Japanese in 1623. After prolonged warfare, both parties agreed to a compromise in 1667. The Dutch retired from India to focus on their more profitable trade in Indonesia, monopolising the trade in black pepper and spices. The Dutch traded in silk, cotton, indigo, rice, and opium in India, but got drawn into the trade of the Malay Archipelago, leading to their decline in India.",
    "31": "The Dutch shifted their focus to the Malay Archipelago, leading to their decline in India. In the third Anglo-Dutch War, communication between Surat and Bombay was cut, resulting in the capture of English ships by the Dutch in the Bay of Bengal.",
    "32": "The English defeated the Dutch in the Battle of Hooghly in November 1759, which ended Dutch ambitions in India. The Dutch were more interested in trade than empire building in India, and their main focus was on the Spice Islands of Indonesia. The English were encouraged to venture out to the East after Francis Drake's voyage and the English victory over the Spanish Armada. In 1600, Queen Elizabeth I issued a charter to the 'Governor and Company of Merchants of London trading into the East Indies' for exclusive trading rights.",
    "33": "Initially, the English East India Company had a monopoly of 15 years, which was extended indefinitely in May 1609. As the Dutch focused on the East Indies, the English turned to India for textiles and other trade commodities. Captain Hawkins arrived in India in 1609, but the attempt to establish a factory at Surat failed due to Portuguese opposition. The English began trading at Masulipatnam in 1611 and established a factory there in 1616. In 1612, Captain Thomas Best defeated the Portuguese in the sea off Surat, and Jahangir allowed the English to establish a factory at Surat in early 1613.",
    "34": "In 1615, Sir Thomas Roe came to the court of Jahangir as an ambassador of James I. He secured permission to set up factories at Agra, Ahmedabad, and Broach. The English company faced competition from the Portuguese and the Dutch, but the situation changed in their favor. Bombay was gifted to King Charles II by the King of Portugal and later given to the East India Company in 1668. Bombay became the headquarters in 1687, and there was peace between the English and the Portuguese.",
    "35": "The Dutch agreed not to interfere with the English company's trade in India, improving their position. The English received the 'Golden Farman' from the Sultan of Golconda in 1632, allowing them to trade freely in Golconda's ports. They built a fortified factory at Madras in 1639 and extended their trading activities to Hariharpur and Balasore. They also gained a foothold in Bengal, a large and prosperous province in India.",
    "36": "The English merchants were interested in controlling Bengal for trade and profit. The subahdar of Bengal, Shah Shuja, allowed them to trade in Bengal for an annual payment of Rs 3,000. The English started factories in Hooghly, Kasimbazar, Patna, and Rajmahal. However, customs officers sometimes obstructed their business. The English wanted a fortified settlement at Hooghly for protection, but their appeal to the Mughal governor was unsuccessful, leading to hostilities.",
    "37": "Hostilities broke out between the English and the Mughals after an appeal for redressal of grievances was unsuccessful. The Mughals sacked Hooghly in 1686, and the English retaliated by capturing imperial forts. However, they were forced to leave Hooghly and negotiate with the Mughals to establish a factory at Sutanuti in 1691.",
    "38": "A zamindar named Sobha Singh rebelled, giving the English a reason to fortify their settlement at Sutanuti in 1696. In 1698, they bought the zamindari of Sutanuti, Gobindapur, and Kalikata for Rs 1,200. The fortified settlement was named Fort William in 1700 and became the seat of the eastern presidency with Sir Charles Eyre as its first president. In 1715, the Company secured three farmans from the Mughal emperor Farrukhsiyar, giving them many valuable privileges in Bengal, Gujarat, and Hyderabad."

    "0": "Long ago, there was a time when India was ruled by different people. It is hard to say when one period ended and another began. But, if we start with the arrival of the Europeans, we have to go back to the 15th century. Even before the Mughals came to power. \n\nAt that time, the Arabs controlled the trade routes to India. The Europeans found it hard to get Indian goods like spices, silk, and precious stones. But, in 1453, the Ottoman Turks took over Constantinople. This made it even harder for the Europeans to trade with India.",
    "1": "Long ago, the Ottomans took over Constantinople and controlled the trade routes to India. The Europeans had to rely on Arab Muslim traders to get Indian goods, but they wanted a direct sea route. They built better ships and explored the unknown corners of the East. They also needed spices for cooking and preservation, and the demand for luxury goods grew with prosperity.",
    "2": "As Europe prospered, so did the desire for exotic goods from the East. Venice and Genoa were too small to compete with the Ottoman Turks, but the north Europeans were eager to help Portugal and Spain. Portugal led the way in resisting Islam and exploring new lands, with Prince Henry the Navigator obsessed with finding a sea route to India and bypassing Muslim control.",
    "3": "Long ago, Prince Henry of Portugal had a dream to find a new way to reach India. He wanted to trade with the people there and spread the Christian faith. The Pope gave him permission to sail across the sea to India, but Prince Henry died before he could make the journey. Later, Portugal and Spain divided the world between them, and Portugal set out to find the sea route to India. A brave navigator named Bartholomew Dias sailed around the southern tip of Africa and believed he had found the way. Ten years later, a group of Portuguese ships set sail for India and arrived there in less than a year.",
    "4": "Long ago, a prince named Henry dreamed of sailing to far-off lands to spread his faith. But he passed away before he could make it happen. Later, two countries divided the world between them, with Portugal claiming the east and Spain the west. A Portuguese navigator named Bartholomew Dias found a sea route to India, and ten years later, Vasco Da Gama arrived in India with three ships. The Hindu ruler welcomed him, but Arab traders were worried about the Portuguese taking over the trading system in the Indian Ocean.",
    "5": "The Portuguese wanted to control the eastern trade and make lots of money. Vasco da Gama stayed in India for three months and sold his cargo for a big profit in Europe. Other Europeans wanted to come to India and trade too. Pedro Alvarez Cabral came to Calicut and set up a factory, but there was a fight and some Portuguese died.",
    "6": "After Vasco da Gama's successful trip to India, the Portuguese wanted to control the trade and exclude the Arabs. Pedro Alvarez Cabral arrived in Calicut to trade for spices, but there was conflict and he attacked Arab ships. Later, he made treaties with local rulers. Vasco da Gama returned, but the Zamorin refused to exclude the Arabs. Vasco da Gama became hostile and attacked Arab shipping. This marked a new era in world history.",
    "7": "The Portuguese wanted to find a new way to India to hurt their enemies, the Muslims, Arabs, and Turks. They wanted to take over the trade in spices and find a Christian ruler called Prester John. They hoped to attack the Muslims from two sides and become very powerful.",
    "8": "The Portuguese wanted to find a new way to reach India and take control of the spice trade. They also wanted to defeat their enemies, the Muslims, Arabs, and Turks. They hoped to find a Christian ruler named Prester John and attack the Muslims from two sides. Vasco da Gama set up a trading factory in Cannanore and the Portuguese gradually became powerful. They built fortresses to protect their trade and appointed a governor, Francisco De Almeida, to destroy Muslim trade and build more fortresses. He said that being powerful at sea was more important than having fortresses on land.",
    "9": "When Francisco De Almeida became the governor of India, he wanted to make the Portuguese the rulers of the Indian Ocean. He built fortresses in Cannanore, Kilwa, and other places to protect their trading activities. But he faced a threat from the Mameluke Sultan of Egypt, who wanted to stop the Portuguese. In a naval battle off Diu, Almeida's son was killed, but the next year, Almeida avenged his defeat and crushed the two navies. Almeida's vision was known as the Blue Water Policy. \n\nAfter Almeida, Alfonso de Albuquerque became the governor of India. He wanted to make Portugal the most powerful country in the East. He established bases overlooking all the entrances to the sea, securing strategic control of the Indian Ocean. Albuquerque completed this task before his death and became the real founder of Portuguese power in the East.",
    "10": "Albuquerque, a Portuguese governor, wanted to make his country the master of the Indian Ocean. He built strongholds in East Africa, Malabar, and Malacca. He controlled ship-building centers and introduced a permit system for other ships. He even acquired Goa from the Sultan of Bijapur in 1510. However, his policy of persecuting Muslims was a drawback.",
    "11": "Albuquerque wanted to help his countrymen by getting rid of Muslim businesses in the East. He made Goa stronger and more important for trade. He also told his men to marry Indian women so they could stay in India forever. The Portuguese men became landlords, built new things, and grew new crops. They loved their new home in India.",
    "12": "When Nino da Cunha became governor of Portuguese interests in India, he moved the government headquarters to Goa. Bahadur Shah of Gujarat gave the Portuguese the island of Bassein and promised them a base in Diu. But when Humayun left Gujarat, the people of the town fought with the Portuguese. The ruler of Gujarat was invited to a Portuguese ship and killed in 1537.",
    "13": "In the Deccan, there were many small kingdoms. None of them had strong ships, and they didn't try to make their navy better. The Chinese emperor said his ships couldn't go far. Arab merchants and ship-owners couldn't match the Portuguese. The Portuguese had cannons on their ships. \n\nThe Portuguese State was important in Indian history. They controlled many coastal parts of India within fifty years of Vasco da Gama's arrival. They had taken over about sixty miles of coast around Goa.",
    "14": "Long ago, the Portuguese arrived in India led by Vasco da Gama. They quickly gained control of many coastal areas, including a sixty-mile stretch around Goa. They had four important ports and many towns and villages under their control. They also had a chain of seaport fortresses and trading-posts in the south. The Portuguese even established military posts and settlements on the east coast and in West Bengal. They made treaties with the Deccan sultans and exchanged envoys with many kingdoms in India.",
    "15": "Long ago, the Portuguese came to India and took control of many coastal areas. They had important ports and trading-posts, and even had influence over local rulers. They also established settlements on the east coast. The Portuguese were involved in many battles for power in India and were the last Europeans to leave. The head of their administration was the viceroy, and they had a religious policy that made enemies of the Moors and Arabs. In 1961, the Government of India recaptured Goa, Daman and Diu from them.",
    "16": "Long ago, the Portuguese came to the East with a strong desire to spread Christianity. They did not like the Muslims, who were their enemies in North Africa. At first, they were kind to the Hindus, but later they became cruel to them too. However, the Jesuits made a good impression on the Mughal emperor Akbar, who was interested in theology. He invited two priests to his court, hoping to learn more about Christianity. The Jesuits were happy to go and spread their faith.",
    "17": "When the Jesuit fathers Aquaviva and Monserrate arrived in Fatehpur Sikri, they were welcomed with respect. But their hope of converting Emperor Akbar to Christianity was not fulfilled. Two more missions were sent, but they too failed. The third mission, led by Fathers Xavier and Pinheiro, stayed in Lahore and became influential in politics. Jahangir, who became the new emperor, initially ignored the Jesuits but later allowed them to keep their church and residence.",
    "18": "The Jesuit priests were allowed to keep their church in Lahore and even baptized people in Agra. They hoped to convert Jahangir to Christianity, but it didn't happen. The Portuguese also caused problems with the Mughal emperor. Captain Hawkins from England was able to meet Jahangir and do business with him, despite the Portuguese's efforts to stop him.",
    "19": "Hawkins spoke the Turki language and talked with Jahangir without an interpreter. Jahangir liked him and made him a mansabdar of 400 with a salary of Rs 30,000. Hawkins married Mubarikesha, an Armenian Christian's daughter. The Portuguese were angry with the English trading facilities, but they made peace with the Mughal emperor. Hawkins left in 1611, but in 1612, Captain Best fought and won against the Portuguese. Jahangir was impressed, and the Portuguese piracy caused problems with the Mughal government.",
    "20": "The Portuguese were causing trouble by stealing from Mughal ships and hurting Muslims. Jahangir was angry and ordered compensation. But it was Shah Jahan who finally stopped the Portuguese from having too much power in the Mughal court. The Portuguese had hoped to convert the royal family to Christianity, but that dream was lost. Meanwhile, the Portuguese had built big buildings in Hooghly and moved their trade there.",
    "21": "Long ago, the Portuguese came to a land called Mughal India. They traded and made money, but they also did bad things. They took Hindu and Muslim children and made them Christians. They even took two girls from a very important family. The Mughal leader, Shah Jahan, was very angry and ordered his soldiers to capture the Portuguese city of Hooghly. After three months, they succeeded and the Portuguese had to leave. Some soldiers were taken as prisoners and given a choice to become Muslim or slaves. The bad things the Portuguese did to the people of Mughal India stopped after this.",
    "22": "Long ago, the Portuguese came to India and became very rich by trading salt and tobacco. But they also did bad things, like taking Hindu and Muslim children as slaves. They even took two girls from Mumtaz Mahal! The Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan, was angry and attacked the Portuguese in Hooghly. After a long fight, the Portuguese had to leave. Later, they lost their power because other countries became stronger and people didn't like their bad behavior.",
    "23": "Long ago, the Portuguese came to India with swords and crosses. They found gold and forgot about the crosses, filling their pockets instead. They became pirates and made enemies with rulers and the Mughals. They also tried to convert Hindus to Christianity, which made them angry. The Dutch and English learned the sea route to India, ending Portuguese trade monopoly. Portugal also got involved in Spain's wars and discovered Brazil, so they left India.",
    "24": "The Portuguese were once sea pirates who were known for their arrogance and violence. They came to India with a sword in one hand and a crucifix in the other, but soon forgot about the crucifix when they found gold. However, their monopoly of trade in India was challenged by the Dutch and the English, who were also learning the skills of ocean navigation. These new competitors had greater resources and overcame the Portuguese resistance, leading to a fierce rivalry among them. In the end, the Portuguese had to give way to the more powerful and enterprising competitors.",
    "25": "Long ago, when new traders from Europe came to India, they fought fiercely for power. The Portuguese were strong, but the Dutch and English were even stronger. They took over the spice trade and Goa lost its importance. The Marathas invaded Goa in 1683. The Portuguese were the first foreign power to come to India by sea, and they used their ships and cannons to gain control of trade.",
    "26": "Long ago, a foreign power arrived in India by way of the sea. They were called the Portuguese and their ships carried powerful weapons called cannon. The Portuguese wanted to control trade and declared they would follow their own rules. They used their weapons to gain an advantage over the Indians and the Indian Ocean trading system. The Portuguese also showed military innovation on land, teaching others how to drill infantry and use guns. They were masters of improved techniques at sea.",
    "27": "The Portuguese ships were strong and had many levels, with big guns to protect them. They had special parts at the front and back to stop enemies from getting on board. The Indians copied these ideas. The Portuguese were also good at planning and had special places to make and fix their ships. They taught other Europeans how to do this too. The Portuguese also helped Indian artists, but some people remember them for being mean to different religions.",
    "28": "The Portuguese were great sailors who built strong ships to withstand storms. They also had powerful weapons to protect themselves from enemies. They taught Indians how to make beautiful art and music. The Dutch were also good sailors and formed a company to trade and fight wars. They built their first factory in Masulipatnam.",
    "29": "Long ago, the Dutch sailed to India and built their first factory in Masulipatnam. They made many trading centers and became a threat to the Portuguese. They captured Nagapatam and made it their main stronghold in South India. They built factories in many places like Surat, Bengal, and Bihar. They traded many things like indigo, textiles, and opium.",
    "30": "Long ago, the Dutch came to India and set up trading centres in many places. They became a threat to the Portuguese and even captured their stronghold in South India. They traded many things like indigo, textiles, and rice. But then, the English also came to trade in the East and this made the Dutch very angry. They even had a big fight in a place called Amboyna. After many years of fighting, they made a deal. The British left Indonesia and the Dutch left India to focus on trading spices in Indonesia. The Dutch slowly stopped trading in India and started trading in the Malay Archipelago instead.",
    "31": "The Dutch were once powerful in India, but they became greedy and wanted more. They went to the Malay Archipelago to trade, but this made them weak. They fought with the English and captured their ships. But, in the end, they lost their power and had to leave India.",
    "32": "The Dutch and English were rivals in India. The Dutch wanted to trade and colonize the East Indies, while the English wanted a share of the profits. In a battle, the English defeated the Dutch, crushing their ambitions in India. The Dutch were more interested in trading spices from Indonesia, where they made a lot of money. The English formed a company to trade in the East Indies, with exclusive rights granted by Queen Elizabeth I.",
    "33": "Long ago, the Dutch were not interested in ruling India, but they loved to trade. They made a lot of money from the Spice Islands in Indonesia. The English saw this and wanted to join in. They formed a company called the 'Governor and Company of Merchants of London trading into the East Indies' in 1600. They were given a monopoly for 15 years, which was extended indefinitely in 1609. They tried to set up a factory in Surat, but the Portuguese stopped them. They succeeded in Masulipatnam in 1611 and Surat in 1613.",
    "34": "Sir Thomas Roe went to meet Jahangir, the Mughal emperor, in 1615. He stayed there for four years but couldn't make a trade deal. However, he got permission to set up factories in Agra, Ahmedabad, and Broach. The English company had a tough time with the Portuguese and Dutch, but things changed. Bombay was gifted to King Charles II, and later, the East India Company got it for a small fee. Bombay became the headquarters in 1687, and there was peace between the English and Portuguese.",
    "35": "Long ago, the English company faced many challenges in India. They had to compete with the Portuguese and the Dutch for trade. But things changed when Bombay was gifted to King Charles II and later given to the English company. They also received a special permission to trade in Golconda and built a fortified factory in Madras. They even started trading in Bengal, a rich province in India. With the help of these privileges, the English company became successful in India.",
    "36": "The English merchants wanted to control Bengal's trade and politics. The governor, Shah Shuja, agreed to let them trade for Rs 3,000 a year. They started factories in Hooghly, Kasimbazar, Patna, and Rajmahal. But sometimes, customs officers asked for tolls. The English wanted a fortified settlement in Hooghly, but the Mughal governor, Shaista Khan, didn't help. So, the English and Mughals fought.",
    "37": "After the English appealed for help, the Mughals refused to listen. This led to a fight between the two groups. Four years later, the Mughals attacked and destroyed Hooghly. The English fought back by capturing Mughal forts and raiding their territories. However, they were forced to leave Hooghly and move to an unhealthy location. Later, they negotiated with the Mughals and returned to Sutanuti, where they established a factory and paid Rs 3,000 a year. A zamindar's rebellion gave them the chance to fortify their settlement in 1696.",
    "38": "After returning to Sutanuti, the English faced rebellion from a zamindar named Sobha Singh. This gave them the chance to fortify their settlement in 1696. Two years later, they bought the zamindari of Sutanuti, Gobindapur, and Kalikata for Rs 1,200.

However, Prince Henry died before his dream could become a reality. In 1497, under the Treaty of Tordesillas (1494), the rulers of Portugal and Spain divided the non-Christian world between them by an imaginary line in the Atlantic, some 1,300 miles west of the Cape Verde Islands.

The situation was thus prepared for the Portuguese incursions into the waters around India.

The English Charter of Queen Elizabeth I Francis Drake\u2019s voyage around the world in 1580 and the English victory over the Spanish Armada in 1588 generated a new sense of enterprise in the British, encouraging sailors to venture out to the East. As the knowledge grew of the high profits earned by the Portuguese in Eastern trade, English traders too wanted a share. So, in 1599, a group of English merchants calling themselves the \u2018Merchant Adventurers\u2019 formed a company. On December 31, 1600, Queen Elizabeth I issued a charter with rights of exclusive trading to the company named the \u2018Governor and Company of Merchants of London trading into the East Indies\u2019. .\n    In the above context, create a multiple choice quiz for the follwowing text.

The Portuguese ships carried cannon, and this was the first step in gaining monopoly over trade\u2014with the threat or actual use of force. . \n    In the context given above, Extract the most important dates out of the following chunk.

Chunk: The Portuguese ships carried cannon, and this was the first step in gaining monopoly over trade\u2014with the threat or actual use of force. The Portuguese declared their intention to abide by no rules except their own, and they were intent on getting a decisive advantage over the Indians and over the Indian Ocean trading system. In the Malabar of the 16th century, the Portuguese showed military innovation in their use of body armour, matchlock men, and guns landed from the ships. The Portuguese may have contributed by example to the Mughal use of field guns, and the \u2018artillery of the stirrup\u2019. However, an important military contribution made by the Portuguese onshore was the system of drilling groups of infantry, on the Spanish model, introduced in the 1630s as a counter to Dutch pressure. The practice was adopted first by the French and English, and later taken up by the Marathas and Sikhs, and such armies of sepoys became new tools of empire in India. The Portuguese were masters of improved techniques at sea. ",
